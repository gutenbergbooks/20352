<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The Compiler of this new <span class="smcap">Jest Book</span> is desirous to make known that it is
composed mainly of old jokes,&mdash;some older than Joe Miller himself,&mdash;with
a liberal sprinkling of new jests gathered from books and hearsay. In
the course of his researches he has been surprised to find how many
Jests, Impromptus, and Repartees have passed current, century after
century, until their original utterer is lost in the "mist of ages"; a
Good Joke being transferred from one reputed Wit to another, thus
resembling certain rare Wines which are continually being rebottled but
are never consumed. Dr. Darwin and Sir Charles Lyell, when they have
satisfied themselves as to the <i>Origin of Species</i> and the <i>Antiquity of
Man</i>, could not better employ their speculative minds than in
determining the origin and antiquity of the venerable "joes" which have
been in circulation beyond the remembrance of that mythical personage,
"the Oldest Inhabitant."</p>

<p>A true Briton loves a good joke, and regards it like "a thing of
beauty," "a joy forever," therefore we may opine that Yorick's "flashes
of merriment, which were wont to set the table in a roar," when Hamlet
was king in Denmark, were transported hither by our Danish invaders, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>descended to Wamba, Will Somers, Killigrew, and other accredited
jesters, until Mr. Joseph Miller reiterated many of them over his pipe
and tankard, when seated with his delighted auditory at the <i>Black Jack</i>
in Clare Market.</p>

<p>Modern Research has been busy with honest Joe's fame, decreeing the
collection of his jests to Captain Motley, who wrote short-lived plays
in the time of the First and Second Georges; but the same false Medium
has affected to discover that Dick Whittington did not come to London
City at the tail of a road wagon, neither was he be-ladled by a cross
cook, and driven forth to Highgate, when Bow Bells invited him to return
and make venture of his Cat, marry Fitzalwyn's daughter, and be thrice
Lord Mayor of London, albeit it is written in City chronicles, that
Whittington's statue and the effigy of his gold-compelling Grimalkin
long stood over the door of New Gate prison-house. We would not have
destroyed the faith of the Rising Generation and those who are to
succeed it in that Golden Legend, to have been thought as wise as the
Ptolemies, or to have been made president of all the Dryasdusts in
Europe. No. Let us not part with our old belief in honest Joe Miller,
but trust rather to Mr. Morley, the historian of Bartlemy Fair, and
visit the Great Theatrical Booth over against the Hospital gate of St.
Bartholomew, where Joe, probably, is to dance "the English Maggot
dance," and after the appearance of "two Harlequins, conclude with a
Grand Dance and Chorus, accompanied with Kettledrums-&nbsp;and Trumpets." And
when the Fair is over, and we are no longer invited to "walk up," let us
march in the train of the great Mime, until he takes his ease in his
inn,&mdash;the <i>Black Jack</i> aforesaid,&mdash;and laugh at his jibes and flashes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>merriment, before the Mad Wag shall be silenced by the great killjoy,
Death, and the jester's boon companions shall lay him in the graveyard
in Portugal Fields, placing over him a friendly record of his social
virtues.</p>

<p>Joe Miller was a fact, and Modern Research shall not rob us of that
conviction!</p>

<p>The compiler of this volume has felt the importance of his task, and
diligently sought how to distinguish true wit from false,&mdash;the pure gold
from Brummagem brass. He has carefully perused the Eight learned
chapters on "Thoughts on Jesting," by Frederick Meier, Professor of
Philosophy at Halle, and Member of the Royal Academy of Berlin, wherein
it is declared that a jest "is an extreme fine Thought, the result of a
great Wit and Acumen, which are eminent Perfections of the Soul." ...
"Hypocrites, with the appearance but without the reality of virtue,
condemn from the teeth outwardly the Laughter and Jesting which they
sincerely approve in their hearts; and many sincere virtuous Persons
also account them criminal, either from Temperament, Melancholy, or
erroneous Principles of Morality. As the Censure of such Persons gives
me pain, so their Approbation would give me great pleasure. But as long
as they consider the suggestions of their Temperament, deep Melancholy,
and erroneous Principles as so many Dictates of real Virtue, so long
they must not take it amiss if, while I revere their Virtue, I despise
their Judgment."</p>

<p>Nor has he disregarded Mr. Locke, who asserts that "Wit lies in an
assemblage of ideas, and putting them together with quickness and
vivacity, whenever can be found any resemblance and congruity whereby to
make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions of fancy."</p>

<p>Neither has Mr. Addison been overlooked, who limits his definition by
observing that "an assemblage of Ideas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> productive merely of pleasure
does not constitute Wit, but of those only which to delight add
surprise."</p>

<p>Nor has he forgotten Mr. Pope, who declares Wit "to consist in a quick
conception of Thought and an easy Delivery"; nor the many other
definitions by Inferior hands, "too numerous to mention."</p>

<p>The result of an anxious consideration of these various Opinions, was a
conviction that to define Wit was like the attempt to define Beauty,
"which," said the Philosopher, "was the question of a Blind man"; and
despairing, therefore, of finding a Standard of value, the Compiler of
the following pages has gathered from every available source the Odd
sayings of all Times, carefully eschewing, however, the Coarse and the
Irreverent, so that of the Seventeen Hundred Jests here collected, not
one need be excluded from Family utterance. Of course, every one will
miss some pet Jest from this Collection, and, as a consequence, declare
it to be miserably incomplete. The Compiler mentions this probability to
show that he has not been among the Critics for nothing.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>The gravest beast is an ass; the gravest bird is an owl;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The gravest fish is an oyster; and the gravest man is a fool</i>!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>says honest Joe Miller; and with that Apophthegm the Compiler doffs his
Cap and Bells, and leaves you, Gentle Reader, in the Merry Company he
has brought together.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_JEST_BOOK" id="THE_JEST_BOOK"></a>THE JEST BOOK.</h2>

<h4>I.&mdash;THE RISING SON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Pope</span> dining once with Frederic, Prince of Wales, paid the prince many
compliments. "I wonder, Pope," said the prince, "that you, who are so
severe on kings, should be so complaisant to me."&mdash;"It is," said the
wily bard, "because I like the lion before his claws are grown."</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;SOMETHING FOR DR. DARWIN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Watkin Williams Wynne</span> talking to a friend about the antiquity of his
family, which he carried up to Noah, was told that he was a mere
mushroom of yesterday. "How so, pray?" said the baronet. "Why,"
continued the other, "when I was in Wales, a pedigree of a particular
family was shown to me: it filled five large skins of parchment, and
near the middle of it was a note in the margin: '<i>About this time the
world was created</i>.'"</p>

<h4>III.&mdash;A BAD EXAMPLE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> noble lord being in his early years much addicted to
dissipation, his mother advised him to take example by a gentleman,
whose food was herbs and his drink water. "What! madam," said he, "would
you have me to imitate a man who <i>eats like a beast, and drinks like a
fish</i>?"</p>

<h4>IV.&mdash;A CONFIRMED INVALID.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A poor</span> woman, who had attended several confirmations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> was at length
recognized by the bishop. "Pray, have I not seen you here before?" said
his lordship. "Yes," replied the woman, "I get me conform'd as often as
I can; they tell me it is <i>good for the rheumatis</i>."</p>

<h4>V.&mdash;COMPARISONS ARE ODIOUS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor Hardwick's</span> bailiff, having been ordered by his lady to
procure a sow of a particular description, came one day into the
dining-room when full of company, proclaiming with a burst of joy he
could not suppress, "I have been at Royston fair, my lady, and I have
got a sow exactly of <i>your ladyship's size</i>."</p>

<h4>VI.&mdash;AN INSCRIPTION ON INSCRIPTIONS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following lines were written on seeing a farrago of rhymes that had
been scribbled with a diamond on the window of an inn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ye who on windows thus prolong your shames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to such arrant nonsense sign your names,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The diamond quit&mdash;with me the pencil take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall <i>your shame</i> but short duration make;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lo, the housemaid comes, in dreadful pet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With red right hand, and with a dishclout wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dashes out all, nor leaves a wreck to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who 't was that <i>wrote so ill!&mdash;and loved so well</i>!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>VII.&mdash;NO HARM DONE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> of sagacity, being informed of a serious quarrel between two of
his female relations, asked the persons if in their quarrels either had
called the other ugly? On receiving an answer in the negative, "O, then,
I shall soon make up the quarrel."</p>

<h4>VIII.&mdash;BEARDING A BARBER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Highlander</span>, who sold brooms, went into a barber's shop in Glasgow to
get shaved. The barber bought one of his brooms, and, after having
shaved him, asked the price of it. "Tippence," said the Highlander. "No,
no," says the shaver; "I'll give you a penny, and if that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> does not
satisfy you, take your broom again." The Highlander took it, and asked
what he had to pay. "A penny," says Strap. "I'll gie ye a baubee," says
Duncan, "and if that dinna satisfy ye, <i>pit on</i> my beard again."</p>

<h4>IX.&mdash;CHANGING HIS COAT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A wealthy</span> merchant of Fenchurch Street, lamenting to a confidential
friend that his daughter had eloped with one of his footmen, concluded,
by saying, "Yet I wish to forgive the girl, and receive her husband, as
it is now too late to part them. But then his condition; how can I
introduce him?"&mdash;"Nonsense," replied his companion; "introduce him as a
<i>Liveryman</i> of the <i>city of London</i>. <i>What</i> is more honorable?"</p>

<h4>X.&mdash;GOOD ADVICE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady</span> &mdash;&mdash; spoke to the butler to be saving of an excellent cask of small
beer, and asked him how it might be best preserved. "I know no method so
effectual, my lady," replied the butler, "as placing a barrel of <i>good</i>
ale by it."</p>

<h4>XI.&mdash;NEW RELATIONSHIP.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A stranger</span> to law courts hearing a judge call a sergeant "brother,"
expressed his surprise. "Oh," said one present, "they are
brothers&mdash;<i>brothers-in-law</i>."</p>

<h4>XII.&mdash;A SMALL INHERITANCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the habit of Lord Eldon, when Attorney-General, to close his
speeches with some remarks justifying his own character. At the trial of
Horne Tooke, speaking of his own reputation, he said: "It is the little
inheritance I have to leave my children, and, by God's help, I will
leave it unimpaired." Here he shed tears; and, to the astonishment of
those present, Mitford, the Solicitor-General, began to weep. "Just look
at Mitford," said a by-stander to Horne Tooke; "what on earth is he
crying for?" Tooke replied, "He is crying to think what a <i>small</i>
inheritance Eldon's children are likely to get."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<h4>XIII.&mdash;A DIFFERENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerrold</span> one day met a Scotch gentleman, whose name was Leitch, and who
explained that he was not the popular caricaturist, John Leech. "I'm
aware of that; you're the Scotchman with the <i>i-t-c-h</i> in your name,"
said Jerrold.</p>

<h4>XIV.&mdash;THE LIGHT SUBJECT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> government, having threatened to proceed rigorously against those
who refused to pay the assessed taxes, offered to them a remission of
<i>one fourth</i>. "This at least," said a sufferer, "may be called, giving
them some <i>quarter</i>."</p>

<h4>XV.&mdash;COMPLIMENTARY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord North</span>, who was very corpulent before a severe sickness, said to his
physician after it, "Sir, I am obliged to you for introducing me to some
old acquaintances."&mdash;"Who are they, my lord?"&mdash;"<i>My ribs,</i>" replied his
lordship, "which I have not felt for many years until now."</p>

<h4>XVI.&mdash;A FAIR SUBSTITUTE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lord Sandwich was to present Admiral Campbell, he told him, that
probably the king would knight him. The admiral did not much relish the
honor. "Well, but," said Lord S., "perhaps Mrs. Campbell will like
it."&mdash;"Then let the king <i>knight her</i>," answered the rough seaman.</p>

<h4>XVII.&mdash;A CONSTITUTIONAL PUN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel Purcell</span>, the famous punster, was desired to make a pun extempore.
"Upon what subject?" said Daniel. "The king," answered the other. "O,
sir," said he, "the <i>king</i> is no <i>subject</i>."</p>

<h4>XVIII.&mdash;A CONVERT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A notorious</span> miser having heard a very eloquent charity sermon,
exclaimed, "This sermon strongly proves the necessity of alms. I have
almost a mind to turn <i>beggar</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<h4>XIX.&mdash;INCREDIBLE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheridan</span> made his appearance one day in a pair of new boots; these
attracting the notice of some of his friends, "Now guess," said he, "how
I came by these boots?" Many <i>probable</i> guesses then took place. "No!"
said Sheridan, "no, you've not hit it, nor ever will,&mdash;I bought them,
and paid for them!"</p>

<h4>XX.&mdash;ALL THE DIFFERENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a large party, one evening, the conversation turned upon young men's
allowance at college. Tom Sheridan lamented the ill-judging parsimony of
many parents in that respect. "I am sure, Tom," said his father, "you
need not complain; I always allowed you eight hundred a year."&mdash;"Yes,
father, I must confess you <i>allowed</i> it; but then it was never paid."</p>

<h4>XXI.&mdash;SPIRITUAL AND SPIRITUOUS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Pitcairn</span> had one Sunday stumbled into a Presbyterian church,
probably to beguile a few idle moments (for few will accuse that
gentleman of having been a warm admirer of <i>Calvinism</i>), and seeing the
parson apparently overwhelmed by the importance of his subject: "What
makes the man <i>greet</i>?" said Pitcairn to a fellow that stood near him.
"By my faith, sir," answered the other, "you would perhaps greet, too,
if you were in his place, <i>and had as little to say</i>."&mdash;"Come along with
me, friend, and let's have a glass together; you are too good a fellow
to be here," said Pitcairn, delighted with the man's repartee.</p>

<h4>XXII.&mdash;A WONDERFUL WOMAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a late Duchess of Bedford was last at Buxton, and then in her
eighty-fifth year, it was the medical farce of the day for the faculty
to resolve every complaint of whim and caprice into "a shock of the
nervous system." Her grace, after inquiring of many of her friends in
the rooms what brought them there, and being generally answered for a
nervous complaint, was asked in her turn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> "What brought her to
Buxton?"&mdash;"I came only for pleasure," answered the healthy duchess;
"for, thank God, I was born before <i>nerves came into fashion</i>."</p>

<h4>XXIII.&mdash;A WISE SON WHO KNEW HIS OWN FATHER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheridan</span> was very desirous that his son Tom should marry a young woman
of large fortune, but knew that Miss Callander had won his son's heart.
Sheridan, expatiating on the folly of his son, at length exclaimed,
"Tom, if you marry Caroline Callander, I'll cut you off with a
shilling!" Tom could not resist the opportunity of replying, and looking
archly at his father said, "Then, sir, you must <i>borrow</i> it." Sheridan
was tickled at the wit, and dropped the subject.</p>

<h4>XXIV.&mdash;A WRITTEN CHARACTER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">George III.</span> having purchased a horse, the dealer put into his hands a
large sheet of paper, completely written over. "What's this?" said his
majesty. "The pedigree of the horse, sire, which you have just bought,"
was the answer. "Take it back, take it back," said the king, laughing;
"it will do very well for the <i>next horse you sell</i>."</p>

<h4>XXV.&mdash;WELL MATCHED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Busby</span>, whose figure was beneath the common size, was one day
accosted in a public coffee-room by an Irish baronet of colossal
stature, with, "May I pass to my seat, O Giant?" When the doctor,
politely making way, replied, "Pass, O Pigmy!"&mdash;"O, sir," said the
baronet, "my expression alluded to the <i>size of your intellect</i>."&mdash;"And
my expression, sir," said the doctor, "to the <i>size of yours</i>."</p>

<h4>XXVI.&mdash;A PARDONABLE MISTAKE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A butcher</span> of some eminence was lately in company with several ladies at
a game of whist, where, having lost two or three rubbers, one of the
ladies addressing him, asked, "Pray, sir, what are the stakes now?" To
which, ever mindful of his occupation, he immediately replied, "Madam,
the best rump I cannot <i>sell</i> lower than tenpence halfpenny <i>a pound</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h4>XXVII.&mdash;THREE CAUSES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> gentlemen being in a coffee-house, one called for a dram, <i>because
he was hot</i>. "Bring me another," says his companion, "<i>because I am
cold</i>." The third, who sat by and heard them, very quietly called out,
"Here, boy, bring me a glass, <i>because I like it</i>."</p>

<h4>XXVIII.&mdash;THE CONNOISSEUR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> to whom the curiosities, buildings, &amp;c., in Oxford were shown
one very hot day, was asked by his companion if he would see the
remainder of the University. "My dear sir," replied the connoisseur, "I
am <i>stone blind</i> already."</p>

<h4>XXIX.&mdash;A SYMBOL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A satiric</span> poet underwent a severe drubbing, and was observed to walk
ever afterwards with a stick. "Mr. P. reminds me," says a wag, "of some
of the saints, who are always painted with <i>the symbols</i> of their
martyrdom."</p>

<h4>XXX.&mdash;THE ONE THING WANTING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a small party, the subject turning on matrimony, a lady said to her
sister, "I wonder, my dear, you have never made a <i>match</i>; I think you
want the <i>brimstone</i>";&mdash;she replied, "No, not the <i>brimstone</i>, only the
<i>spark</i>."</p>

<h4>XXXI.&mdash;A HORSE LAUGH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A coachman</span>, extolling the sagacity of one of his horses, observed, that
"if anybody was to go for to use him ill, he would <i>bear malice</i> like a
<i>Christian</i>."</p>

<h4>XXXII.&mdash;ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. A.</span>, physician at Newcastle, being summoned to a vestry, in order to
reprimand the sexton for drunkenness, he dwelt so long on the sexton's
misconduct, as to draw from him this expression: "Sir, I thought you
would have been the last man alive to appear against me, as <i>I have

who interposed, "that she should see if there was any fellow alive that
had the impudence!"&mdash;"Pr'ythee, my dear, don't be so rash," replied the
good man; "you don't know what a man may do <i>in a passion</i>."</p>

<h4>XXXIX.&mdash;"ONE FOR HIS NOB."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A barrister</span> entered the hall with his wig very much awry, of which he

<p><span class="smcap">A fellow</span> boasting in company of his family, declared even his own father

another observed, "I can bear testimony to the gentleman's veracity, as
my father was sheriff for the county when his was <i>hanged</i> for

<h4>XLIV.&mdash;REVERSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> General V&mdash;&mdash; was quartered in a small town in Ireland, he and his
lady were regularly besieged as they got into their carriage by an old
beggar-woman, who kept her post at the door, assailing them daily with
fresh importunities. One morning, as Mrs. V. stepped into the carriage,
the woman began: "Oh, my lady! success to your ladyship, and success to
your honor's honor: for sure I did not <i>dream</i> last night that her
ladyship gave me a pound of tea, and your honor gave me a pound of
tobacco."&mdash;"My good woman," said the general, "dreams go by the rule of

<h4>XLIX.&mdash;PASSING THE BOTTLE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Foote</span> being in company, and the wine producing more riot than concord,

out the evening."</p>

<h4>L.&mdash;"JUNIUS" DISCOVERED.</h4>

whether he was the author of Junius. The poet approached the knight,
"Will you, Sir Philip,&mdash;will your kindness excuse my addressing to you a
single question?"&mdash;"At your peril, sir!" was the harsh and the laconic
answer. The intimidated bard retreated to his friends, who eagerly asked
him the result of his application. "I don't know," he answered, "whether
he is <i>Junius</i>; but, if he be, he is certainly <i>Junius Brutus</i>."</p>

<h4>LI.&mdash;A WEAK WOMAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A loving</span> husband once waited on a physician to request him to prescribe

shall soon know it." The lieutenant flew back to the scene of danger,
and almost instantly returning, exclaimed, "You need not, sir, be
afraid, the fire is extinguished."&mdash;"Afraid!" exclaimed Howe, "what do
you mean by that, sir? I never was afraid in my life"; and looking the
lieutenant full in the face, he added, "Pray, how does a man feel, sir,
when he is afraid? <i>I need not ask how he looks</i>."</p>

<h4>LIV.&mdash;NOTHING BUT THE "BILL."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">John Horne Tooke's</span> opinion upon the subject of law was admirable. "Law,"
he said, "ought to be, not a luxury for the rich, but a remedy, to be
easily, cheaply, and speedily obtained by the poor." A person observed
to him, how excellent are the English laws, because they are impartial,
and our courts of justice are open to all persons without distinction.
"And so," said Tooke, "is the <i>London Tavern</i>, to such as can afford to
<i>pay for their entertainment</i>."</p>

<h4>LV.&mdash;AN EXTINGUISHER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Commodore Anson's ship, the Centurion, was engaged in close fight,

shot passed through the man's hat, but missed the bird. "Did you fire at
me, sir?" he hastily asked. "O! no, sir," said the shrewd sportsman, "I
<i>never hit</i> what I fire at."</p>

<h4>LVII.&mdash;WISE PRECAUTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is related of the great Dr. Clarke, that when in one of his leisure
hours he was unbending himself with a few friends in the most playful
and frolicsome manner, he observed Beau Nash approaching; upon which he
suddenly stopped: "My boys," said he, "let us be <i>grave</i>: here comes a
<i>fool</i>."</p>

<h4>LVIII.&mdash;A TRUMP CARD.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> one of the Holland-house Sunday dinner-parties, a year or two ago,
Crockford's Club, then forming, was talked of; and the noble hostess
observed, that the female passion for diamonds was surely less ruinous
than the rage for play among men. "In short, you think," said Mr.
Rogers, "that <i>clubs</i> are worse than <i>diamonds</i>." This joke excited a
laugh; and when it had subsided, Sydney Smith wrote the following
<i>impromptu</i> sermonet&mdash;most appropriately <i>on a card</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thoughtless that "all that's brightest fades,"<br /></span>

<p><span class="smcap">A physician</span> attending a lady several times, had received a couple of
guineas each visit; at last, when he was going away, she gave him but
one; at which he was surprised, and looking on the floor, "I believe,
madam," said he, "I have <i>dropt a guinea</i>."&mdash;"No, sir," replied the
lady, "it is I that have <i>dropt it</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<h4>LX.&mdash;ALONE IN HIS GLORY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A facetious</span> fellow having unwittingly offended a conceited puppy, the

not</i>," replied the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hickringal</span>, who was one of King Charles the Second's chaplains,
whenever he preached before his Majesty, was sure to tell him of his
faults from the pulpit. One day his Majesty met the doctor in the Mall,
and said to him, "Doctor, what have I done to you that you are always
quarrelling with me?"&mdash;"I hope your Majesty is not angry with me," quoth
the doctor, "for telling the truth."&mdash;"No, no," says the king, "but I
would have us for the future be friends."&mdash;"Well, well," quoth the
doctor, "I will make it up with your Majesty on these terms,&mdash;as <i>you
mend I'll mend</i>."</p>

<h4>LXIII.&mdash;SUBTRACTION AND ADDITION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A chimney-sweeper's</span> boy went into a baker's shop for a twopenny loaf,
and conceiving it to be diminutive in size, remarked to the baker that
he did not believe it was weight. "Never mind that," said the man of
dough, "you will have <i>the less to carry</i>."&mdash;"True," replied the lad,
and throwing three half-pence on the counter left the shop. The baker
called after him that he had not left money enough. "Never mind that,"
said young sooty, "you will have <i>the less to count</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h4>LXIV.&mdash;THE DOCTRINE OF CHANCES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Kames</span> used to relate a story of a man who claimed the honor of his
acquaintance on rather singular grounds. His lordship, when one of the
justiciary judges, returning from the north circuit to Perth, happened
one night to sleep at Dunkeld. The next morning, walking towards the
ferry, but apprehending he had missed his way, he asked a man whom he
met to conduct him. The other answered with much cordiality: "That I
will do, with all my heart, my lord; does not your lordship remember me?
My name's John &mdash;&mdash;; I have had the honor to be before your lordship for
stealing sheep?"&mdash;"Oh, John, I remember you well; and how is your wife?
she had the honor to be before me, too, for receiving them, knowing them
to be stolen."&mdash;"At your lordship's service. We were very lucky, we got
off for want of evidence; and I am still going on in the butcher
trade."&mdash;"Then," replied his lordship, "we may have the honor of
<i>meeting again</i>."</p>

<h4>LXV.&mdash;A LATE EDITION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with as much delicacy as satire that Porson returned, with the

excuse, and his part was obliged to be read. Hobhouse came forward to
apologize to the audience, and told them that <i>a</i> Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had declined
to perform his part. The gentleman was highly indignant at the "<i>a</i>,"
and had a great inclination to pick a quarrel with Scrope Davies, who

not the same thing?" said the chancellor. "No, my lord," said Lord

portmanteau, and consequently borrowed one from his lordship. Before
retiring to rest, he sat down to study, as was his common practice,
having first put on the cap, and was shortly after alarmed by finding it
in flames; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> immediately collected the burnt remains, and returned

<h4>XCIII.&mdash;"HE LIES LIKE TRUTH."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> who had resided for some time on the coast of Africa was asked
if he thought it possible to civilize the natives. "As a proof of the
possibility of it," said he, "I have known some negroes that thought as
little of a <i>lie</i> or an <i>oath</i> as any European."</p>

<h4>XCIV.&mdash;HAND AND GLOVE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A dyer</span>, in a court of justice, being ordered to hold up his hand, that
was all black; "Take off your <i>glove</i>, friend," said the judge to him.
"Put on your <i>spectacles</i>, my lord," answered the dyer.</p>

<h4>XCV.&mdash;VAST DOMAIN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> having a servant with a very thick skull, used often to call
him the king of fools. "I wish," said the fellow one day, "you could
make your words good, I should then be the <i>greatest</i> monarch in the
world."</p>

<h4>XCVI.&mdash;MONEY RETURNED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lawyer</span> being sick, made his last will, and gave all his estate to
fools and madmen: being asked the reason for so doing; "From such," said
he, "I <i>had</i> it, and to such I <i>give</i> it again."</p>

<h4>XCVII.&mdash;CHEESE AND DESSERT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> city ladies meeting at a visit, one a grocer's wife, and the other a
cheesemonger's, when they had risen up and took their departure, the
cheesemonger's wife was going out of the room first, upon which the
grocer's lady, pulling her back by the tail of her gown, and stepping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
before her, said, "No, madam, nothing comes after <i>cheese</i>."</p>

<h4>XCVIII.&mdash;VERY POINTED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir John Hamilton</span>, who had severely suffered from the persecutions of
the law, used to say, that an attorney was like a hedgehog, it was
impossible to touch him anywhere without <i>pricking</i> one's fingers.</p>

<h4>XCIX.&mdash;"THE MIXTURE AS BEFORE."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> who had an Irish servant, having stopped at an inn for
several days, desired to have a bill, and found a large quantity of port
placed to his servant's account, and questioned him about it. "Please
your honor," cried Pat, "do read how many they charge me." The gentleman
began, "One bottle <i>port</i>, one <i>ditto</i>, one <i>ditto</i>, one
<i>ditto</i>,"&mdash;"Stop, stop, stop, master," exclaimed Paddy, "they are
cheating you. I know I had some bottles of their <i>port</i>, but I did not
taste a drop of their <i>ditto</i>."</p>

<h4>C.&mdash;COMPUTATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> Irish counsellor having lost his cause, which had been tried before
three judges, one of whom was esteemed a very able lawyer, and the other
two but indifferent, some of the other barristers were very merry on the
occasion. "Well, now," says he, "I have lost. But who could help it,
when there were an hundred judges on the bench?&mdash;<i>one</i> and <i>two
ciphers</i>."</p>

<h4>CI.&mdash;PRIMOGENITURE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> Irish clergyman having gone to visit the portraits of the Scottish
kings in Holyrood House, observed one of the monarchs of a very youthful
appearance, while <i>his son</i> was depicted with a long beard, and wore the
traits of extreme old age. "Sancta Maria," exclaimed the good Hibernian,
"is it possible that this gentleman was an <i>old man</i> when his father
<i>was born</i>!!"</p>

<h4>CII.&mdash;CHECK TO THE KING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day James the Second, in the middle of his courtiers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> made use of
this assertion: "I never knew a modest man make his way at court." To
this observation one of the gentlemen present boldly replied: "And,
please your majesty, <i>whose fault is that</i>?" The king was struck, and
remained silent.</p>

<h4>CIII.&mdash;A FALL IN MITRES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the wooden <i>mitres</i>, carved by Grinly Gibbons over a prebend's
stall in the cathedral church of Canterbury, happening to become loose,
Jessy White, the surveyor of that edifice, inquired of the dean whether
he should make it fast: "For, perhaps," said Jessy, "it may fall on your
reverence's head."&mdash;"Well! Jessy," answered the humorous Cantab,
"suppose it does fall on my head, I don't know that <i>a mitre falling on
my head</i> would hurt it."</p>

<h4>CIV.&mdash;FALSE DELICACY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span>, disputing with Peter Pindar, said, in great heat, that he did
not like to be thought a scoundrel. "I wish," replied Peter, "that you
had as great a dislike <i>to being a scoundrel</i>."</p>

<h4>CV.&mdash;A BAD HARVEST.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was much sound palpable argument in the speech of a country lad to
an idler, who boasted his ancient family: "So much the worse for you,"
said the peasant; "as we ploughmen say, '<i>the older the seed the worse
the crop</i>.'"</p>

<h4>CVI.&mdash;PROOF IMPRESSION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bethel</span>, an Irish barrister, when the question of the Union was in
debate, like all the junior barristers published pamphlets upon the
subject. Mr. Lysaght met this pamphleteer in the hall of the Four
Courts, and in a friendly way, said, "Zounds! Bethel, I wonder you never
told me you had published a pamphlet on the Union. The one I saw
contained some of the best things I have yet seen in any pamphlet upon
the subject."&mdash;"I'm very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> proud you think so," said the other, rubbing
his hands with satisfaction; "and pray, what are the things that pleased
you so much?"&mdash;"Why," replied Lysaght, "as I passed by a pastry-cook's
shop this morning, I saw a girl come out with three <i>hot mince-pies</i>
wrapped up in one of your works."</p>

<h4>CVII.&mdash;NECK OR NOTHING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A right</span> reverend prelate, himself a man of extreme good-nature, was
frequently much vexed in the spirit by the proud, froward, perverse, and
untractable temper of his next vicar. The latter, after an absence much
longer than usual, one day paid a visit to the bishop, who kindly
inquired the cause of his absence, and was answered by the vicar, that
he had been confined to his house for some time past by an obstinate
<i>stiffness</i> in his <i>knee</i>. "I am glad of that," replied the prelate;
"'tis a good symptom that the disorder has changed place, for I had a
long time thought it <i>immovably settled</i> in your <span class="smcap">neck</span>."</p>

<h4>CVIII.&mdash;ARCADIA.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A farm</span> was lately advertised in a newspaper, in which all the beauty of
the situation, fertility of the soil, and salubrity of the air were
detailed in the richest flow of rural description, which was further
enhanced with this,&mdash;N.B. There is not <i>an attorney</i> within fifteen
miles of the neighborhood.</p>

<h4>CIX.&mdash;QUITE PERFECTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A painter</span> in the Waterloo Road had the following announcement displayed
on the front of his house: "The Acme of Stencil!" A "learned Theban" in
the same line in an adjoining street, in order to outdo the "old
original" stenciller, thus set forth his pretensions: "Stencilling in
all its branches performed in the very height <i>of acme</i>!"</p>

<h4>CX.&mdash;THE LATE MR. COLLINS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Collins</span> the poet, coming into a town the day after a young lady, of whom
he was fond, had left it, said, how unlucky he was that he had come <i>a
day after the fair</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h4>CXI.&mdash;A FAMILY PARTY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> lodging-house was very much infested by vermin. A gentleman
who slept there one night, told the landlady so in the morning, when she
said, "La, sir, we haven't a <i>single</i> bug in the house."&mdash;"No ma'am,"
said he, "they're all <i>married</i>, and have large families too."</p>

<h4>CXII.&mdash;CALF'S HEAD SURPRISED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A stupid</span> person one day seeing a man of learning enjoying the pleasures
of the table, said, "So, sir, philosophers, I see, can indulge in the
greatest delicacies."&mdash;"Why not," replied the other, "do you think
Providence intended all the <i>good things</i> for fools?"</p>

<h4>CXIII.&mdash;POPPING THE QUESTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A girl</span> forced by her parents into a disagreeable match with an old man,
whom she detested, when the clergyman came to that part of the service
where the bride is asked if she consents to take the bridegroom for her
husband, said, with great simplicity, "Oh dear, no, sir; but you are the
first person who has asked <i>my opinion</i> about the matter."</p>

<h4>CXIV.&mdash;SCANDALOUS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was said of a great calumniator, and a frequenter of other person's
tables, that he never <i>opened his mouth</i> but at another man's expense.</p>

<h4>CXV.&mdash;THE PRINCE OF ORANGE AND JUDGE JEFFERIES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Jefferies was told that the Prince of Orange would very soon land,
and that a manifesto, stating his inducements, objects, &amp;c., was already
written, "Pray, my Lord Chief Justice," said a gentleman present, "what
do you think will be the heads of this manifesto?"&mdash;"<i>Mine</i> will be
one," replied he.</p>

<h4>CXVI.&mdash;MODEST REQUEST.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> travelling, was accosted by a man walking along the road,
who begged the favor of him to put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> his great coat, which he found very
heavy, into his carriage. "With all my heart," said the gentleman; "but
if we should not be travelling to the same place, how will you get your
coat?"&mdash;"Monsieur," answered the man with great <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, "<i>I shall be
in it</i>."</p>

<h4>CXVII.&mdash;CAP THIS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Thomas More</span>, the famous Chancellor, who preserved his humor and wit
to the last moment, when he came to be executed on Tower-hill, the
headsman demanded his upper garment as his fee; "Ah! friend," said he,
taking off his cap, "that, I think, is my <i>upper</i> garment."</p>

<h4>CXVIII.&mdash;A PRETTY METAPHOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> lady marrying a man she loved, and leaving many friends in town,
to retire with him into the country, Mrs. D. said prettily, "She has
turned one-and-twenty shillings into a guinea."</p>

<h4>CXIX.&mdash;ON A STONE THROWN AT A VERY GREAT MAN, BUT WHICH MISSED HIM.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Talk</span> no more of the lucky escape of the <i>head</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">From a flint so unluckily thrown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think very diff'rent, with thousands indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas a lucky escape for the <i>stone</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>CXX.&mdash;A MAN OF LETTERS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mr. Wilkes was in the meridian of his popularity, a man in a
porter-house, classing himself as an eminent literary character, was
asked by one of his companions what right he had to assume such a title.
"Sir," says he, "I'd have you know, I had the honor of <i>chalking</i> number
45 upon every door between Temple Bar and Hyde Park-corner."</p>

<h4>CXXI.&mdash;WELSH WIG-GING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> Englishman and a Welshman, disputing in whose country was the best
living, said the Welshman, "There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> is such noble housekeeping in Wales,
that I have known above a dozen cooks employed at one wedding
dinner."&mdash;"Ay," answered the Englishman, "that was because every man
<i>toasted</i> his own cheese."</p>

<h4>CXXII.&mdash;A SPRIG OF SHILLALAH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A fellow</span> on the quay, thinking to <i>quiz</i> a poor Irishman, asked him,
"How do the potatoes eat now, Pat?" The Irish lad, who happened to have
a <i>shillalah</i> in his hand, answered, "O! they eat very well, my jewel,
would you like to taste the <i>stalk</i>?" and knocking the inquirer down,
coolly walked off.</p>

<h4>CXXIII.&mdash;DOG-MATIC.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the great dispute between South and Sherlock, the latter, who was a
great courtier, said, "His adversary reasoned well, but he barked like a
cur." To which the other replied, "That <i>fawning</i> was the property of a
cur as well as barking."</p>

<h4>CXXIV.&mdash;FALSE QUANTITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A learned</span> counsel in the Exchequer spoke of a <i>nolle pros&#275;qui</i>.
"Consider, sir," said Baron Alderson, "that this is the last day of
term, and don't make things <i>unnecessarily long</i>."</p>

<h4>CXXV.&mdash;IN SUSPENSE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sloth, in its wild state, spends its life in trees, and never leaves
them but from force or accident. The eagle to the sky, the mole to the
ground, the sloth to the tree; but what is most extraordinary, he lives
not <i>upon</i> the branches, but <i>under</i> them. He moves suspended, rests
suspended, sleeps suspended, and passes his life in suspense,&mdash;like a
young clergyman <i>distantly related</i> to a bishop.</p>

<h4>CXXVI.&mdash;PORSON'S VISIT TO THE CONTINENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after Professor Porson returned from a visit to the Continent, at a
party where he happened to be present,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> a gentleman solicited a sketch
of his journey. Porson immediately gave the following extemporaneous
one:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I went to Frankfort and got drunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that most learned professor, Brunck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I went to Worts and got more drunken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that more learned professor, Ruhnken."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>CXXVII.&mdash;ARTIFICIAL HEAT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Lord Kelly had a very red face. "Pray, my lord," said Foote to
him, "come and <i>look over</i> my garden-wall,&mdash;my cucumbers are very
backward."</p>

<h4>CXXVIII.&mdash;OUTWARD APPEARANCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span> is a sort of tree which we are too apt to judge of by the bark.</p>

<h4>CXXIX.&mdash;THE TWO SMITHS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span>, with the same Christian and surname, took lodgings in the
same house with James Smith. The consequence was, eternal confusion of
calls and letters. Indeed, the postman had no alternative but to share
the letters equally between the two. "This is intolerable, sir," said
our friend, "and you must quit."&mdash;"Why am I to quit more than
you?"&mdash;"Because you are James the Second&mdash;and must <i>abdicate</i>."</p>

<h4>CXXX.&mdash;SAGE ADVICE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> advice given by an Irishman to his English friend, on introducing
him to a regular Tipperary row, was, "Wherever you see a head, <i>hit
it</i>."</p>

<h4>CXXXI.&mdash;THE PURSER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Hardwicke</span>, the lady of the Chancellor, loved money as well as he
did, and what <i>he</i> got <i>she</i> saved. The purse in which the Great Seal is
carried is of very expensive embroidery, and was provided, during his
time, every year. Lady Hardwicke took care that it should not be
provided for the seal-bearer's profit, for she annually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> retained them
herself, having previously ordered that the velvet should be of the
length of one of the state rooms at Wimpole. So many of them were saved,
that at length she had enough to hang the state-room, and make curtains
for the bed. Lord Hardwicke used to say, "There was not such a <i>purser</i>
in the navy."</p>

<h4>CXXXII.&mdash;A FOREIGN ACCENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Maurice Margarot was tried at Edinburgh for sedition, the Lord
Justice asked him, "Hae you ony counsel, mon?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"Do you want to
hae ony appointed?"&mdash;"I only want an interpreter to make me <i>understand</i>
what your lordships say."</p>

<h4>CXXXIII&mdash;EASY AS LYING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Erskine</span>, examining a bumptious fellow, asked him, if he were not a
rider? "I'm a traveller, sir," replied the witness, with an air of
offended importance. "Indeed, sir. And, pray, are you addicted to the
<i>failing</i> usually attributed to travellers?"</p>

<h4>CXXXIV.&mdash;NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A prisoner</span> in The Fleet sent to his creditor to let him know that he had
a proposal to make, which he believed would be for their mutual benefit.
Accordingly, the creditor calling on him to hear it: "I have been
thinking," said he, "that it is a very idle thing for me to lie here,
and put you to the expense of seven groats a week. My being so
chargeable to you has given me great uneasiness, and who knows what it
may cost you in the end! Therefore, what I propose is this: You shall
let me out of prison, and, instead of <i>seven</i> groats, you shall allow me
only <i>eighteenpence</i> a week, and the other <i>tenpence</i> shall go towards
the discharging of the debt."</p>

<h4>CXXXV.&mdash;EPIGRAM.</h4>

<p class="center">(On the column to the Duke of York's memory.)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">In</span> former times the illustrious dead were burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hearts preserved in sepulchre inurned;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This column, then, commemorates the part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which custom makes us single out&mdash;the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You ask, "How by a column this is done?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I answer, "<i>'Tis a hollow thing of stone</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>CXXXVI.&mdash;FLATTERY TURNED TO ADVANTAGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A dependant</span> was praising his patron for many virtues which he did not
possess. "I will do all in my power to prevent you <i>lying</i>," answered
he.</p>

<h4>CXXXVII.&mdash;THE INTRUDER REBUKED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerrold</span> and some friends were dining in a private room at a tavern.
After dinner the landlord informed the company that the house was partly
under repair, and requested that a stranger might be allowed to take a
chop at a separate table in the apartment. The company assented, and the
stranger, a person of commonplace appearance, was introduced, ate his
chop in silence, and then fell asleep, snoring so loudly and
inharmoniously that conversation was disturbed. Some gentlemen of the
party made a noise, and the stranger, starting from his sleep, shouted
to Jerrold, "I know you, Mr. Jerrold; but you shall not make a butt of
me!"&mdash;"Then don't bring your <i>hog's head</i> in here," was the prompt
reply.</p>

<h4>CXXXVIII.&mdash;CRITICAL POLITENESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> author reading a tragedy, perceived his auditor very often pull
off his hat at the end of a line, and asked him the reason. "I cannot
pass a very <i>old</i> acquaintance," replied the critic, "without that
civility."</p>

<h4>CXXXIX.&mdash;A GOOD PLACE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A nobleman</span> taking leave when going as ambassador, the king said to him,
"The principal instruction you require is, to observe a line of conduct
exactly the reverse to that of your predecessor."&mdash;"Sire," replied he,
"I will endeavor so to act that you shall not have occasion to give <i>my</i>
successor the like advice."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<h4>CXL.&mdash;A CABAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> attempt to run over the King of the French with a cab, looked like a
conspiracy to overturn <i>monarchy</i> by a <i>common-wheel</i>.</p>

<h4>CXLI.&mdash;THE FIRE OF LONDON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> speaking of the fire of London, said, "Cannon Street roared, Bread
Street was burnt to a crust, Crooked Lane was burnt straight, Addle Hill
staggered, Creed Lane would not believe it till it came, Distaff Lane
had sprung a fine thread, Ironmonger Lane was redhot, Seacoal Lane was
burnt to a cinder, Soper Lane was in the suds, the Poultry was too much
singed, Thames Street was dried up, Wood Street was burnt to ashes, Shoe
Lane was burnt to boot, Snow Hill was melted down, Pudding Lane and Pye
Corner were over baked."</p>

<span class="i2">They're <i>little else</i> beside.<br /></span>

<h4>CXLIII.&mdash;AN HONEST HORSE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A dealer</span> once, selling a nag to a gentleman, frequently observed, with
emphatic earnestness, that "he was an <i>honest</i> horse." After the
purchase the gentleman asked him what he meant by an honest horse. "Why,
sir," replied the seller, "whenever I rode him he always threatened to
<i>throw</i> me, and he certainly never <i>deceived</i> me."</p>

<h4>CXLIV.&mdash;THE RETORT CUTTING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishops Sherlock</span> and <span class="smcap">Hoadly</span> were both freshmen of the same year, at
Catherine Hall, Cambridge. The classical subject in which they were
first lectured was Tully's Offices, and one morning Hoadly received a
compliment from the tutor for the excellence of his construing.
Sherlock, a little vexed at the preference shown to his rival,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> said,
when they left the lecture-room, "Ben, you made good use of L'Estrange's
<i>translation</i> to-day."&mdash;"Why, no, Tom," retorted Hoadly, "I did not, for
I had not got one; and I forgot to borrow yours, which, I am told, is
the only one in the college."</p>

<h4>CXLV.&mdash;ELEGANT COMPLIMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Henry Erskine</span>, being one day in London, in company with the Duchess
of Gordon, said to her, "Are we never again to enjoy the honor and
pleasure of your grace's society at Edinburgh?"&mdash;"O!" answered her
grace, "Edinburgh is a vile dull place&mdash;I hate it."&mdash;"Madam," replied
the gallant barrister, "the sun might as well say, there's a vile dark
morning,&mdash;I <i>won't rise</i> to-day."</p>

<h4>CXLVIII.&mdash;A HAPPY SUGGESTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, gave a concert to the
Consumption Hospital, the proceeds of which concert amounted to 1,776l.
15s., and were to be devoted to the completion of the building, Jerrold
suggested that the new part of the hospital should be called "The
Nightingale's Wing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<h4>CXLIX.&mdash;PLAYING ON A WORD.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Orford</span> was present in a large company at dinner, when Bruce, the
celebrated traveller, was talking in his usual style of exaggeration.
Some one asked him what musical instruments were used in Abyssinia.
Bruce hesitated, not being prepared for the question, and at last said,
"I think I saw a <i>lyre</i> there." George Selwyn, who was of the party,
whispered his next man, "Yes, and there is <i>one less</i> since he left the
country."</p>

<h4>CL.&mdash;AN EYE TO PROFIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> speaking of an acquaintance, who, though extremely avaricious,
was always abusing the avarice of others, added, "Is it not strange that
this man will not take the <i>beam out of his own eye</i> before he attempts
the <i>mote</i> in other people's?"&mdash;"Why, so I daresay he would," cried
Sheridan, "if he was sure of <i>selling the timber</i>."</p>

<h4>CLI.&mdash;"OUT, BRIEF CANDLE."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> small officer struck an old grenadier of his company for some
supposed fault in performing his evolutions. The grenadier gravely took
off his cap, and, holding it over the officer by the tip, said, "Sir, if
you were not my officer, I would <i>extinguish</i> you."</p>

<h4>CLII.&mdash;A.I.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A learned</span> barrister, quoting Latin verses to a brother "wig," who did
not appear to understand them, added, "Don't you know the lines? They
are in Martial."&mdash;"Marshall. Oh, yes; Marshall, who wrote on
underwriting."&mdash;"Not so bad," replied the other. "After all, there is
not so much difference between an <i>under writer</i> and a <i>minor</i> poet."</p>

<h4>CLIII.&mdash;QUALIFYING FOR BAIL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> once appeared in the Court of King's Bench to give bail in
the sum of 3,000l. Serjeant Davy, wanting to display his wit, said to
him, sternly, "And pray, sir, how do you make out that you are worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
3,000l.?" The gentleman stated the particulars of his property up to
2,940. "That's all very good," said the serjeant, "but you want 60l.
more to be worth 3,000."&mdash;"For that sum," replied the gentleman, in no
ways disconcerted, "I have a note of hand of one Mr. Serjeant Davy, and
I hope he will have the honesty soon to settle it." The serjeant looked
abashed, and Lord Mansfield observed, in his usual urbane tone, "Well,
brother Davy, I <i>think</i> we may accept the bail."</p>

<h4>CLIV.&mdash;BARRY'S POWERS OF PLEASING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Spranger Barry</span>, to his silver-toned voice, added all the powers of
persuasion. A carpenter, to whom he owed some money for work at the
Dublin Theatre, called at Barry's house, and was very clamorous in
demanding payment. Mr. Barry overhearing him, said from above, "Don't be
in a passion; but do me the favor to walk upstairs, and we'll speak on
the business."&mdash;"Not I," answered the man; "you owe me one hundred
pounds already, and if you get me upstairs, you won't let me leave you
till you owe me <i>two</i>."</p>

<h4>CLV.&mdash;EPIGRAM.</h4>

<h4>CLVII.&mdash;NATIVE WIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> was thought to be very stupid. He was sent to a mill one day, and
the miller said, "John, some people say you are a fool! Now, tell me
what you do know, and what you don't know."&mdash;"Well," replied John, "I
know millers' hogs are fat!"&mdash;"Yes, that's well, John! Now, what don't
you know?"&mdash;"I don't know <i>whose corn</i> fats 'em!"</p>

<h4>CLVIII.&mdash;WORTH THE MONEY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Robert Walpole</span> having misquoted a passage in Horace, Mr. Pulteney
said the honorable gentleman's Latin was as bad as his politics. Sir
Robert adhered to his version, and bet his opponent a guinea that he was
right, proposing Mr. Harding as arbiter. The bet being accepted, Harding
rose, and with ludicrous solemnity gave his decision against his patron.
The guinea was thrown across the House; and when Pulteney stooped to
pick it up, he observed, that "it was the first <i>public money</i> he had
touched for a long time." After his death, the guinea was found wrapped
up in a piece of paper on which the circumstance was recorded.</p>

<h4>CLIX.&mdash;SUITED TO HIS SUBJECT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ballot was, it seems, first proposed in 1795, by Major
<i>Cart-wright</i>, who somewhat appropriately wrote a book upon the
<i>Common-Wheel</i>.</p>

<h4>CLX.&mdash;NOT <i>versus</i> NOTT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> of Maudlin, whose name was <i>Nott</i>, returning late from his
friend's rooms, attracted the attention of the proctor, who demanded his
name and college. "I am <i>Nott</i> of Maudlin," was the reply, hiccupping.
"Sir," said the proctor, in an angry tone, "I did not ask of what
college you are <i>not</i>, but of what college you are."&mdash;"I am <i>Nott</i> of
Maudlin," was again the broken reply. The proctor, enraged at what he
considered contumely, insisted on accompanying him to Maudlin, and
demanded of the porter, "whether he knew the gentleman."&mdash;"Know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> him,
sir," said the porter, "yes, it is Mr. <i>Nott</i> of this college." The
proctor now perceived his error in <i>not</i> understanding the gentleman,
and wished him a good night.</p>

<h4>CLXII.&mdash;THE PINK OF POLITENESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Berkeley</span> was once dining with Lord Chesterfield (the pink of
politeness) and a large party, when it was usual to drink wine until
they were mellow. Berkeley had by accident shot one of his gamekeepers,
and Chesterfield, under the warmth of wine, said, "Pray, my Lord
Berkeley, how long is it since you shot a gamekeeper?"&mdash;"Not since you
hanged <i>your tutor</i>, my lord!" was the reply. You know that Lord
Chesterfield brought Dr. Dodd to trial, in consequence of which he was
hanged.</p>

<h4>CLXIII.&mdash;HIGH AND LOW.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I expect</span> six clergymen to dine with me on such a day," said a gentleman
to his butler. "Very good, sir," said the butler. "Are they High Church
or Low Church, sir?"&mdash;"What on earth can that signify to you?" asked the
astonished master. "Every thing, sir," was the reply. "If they are High
Church, they'll drink; if they are Low Church, <i>they'll eat</i>!"</p>

<h4>CLXV.&mdash;INGENIOUS REPLY OF A SOLDIER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A soldier</span> in the army of the Duke of Marlborough took the name of that
general, who reprimanded him for it. "How am I to blame, general?" said
the soldier. "I have the choice of names; if I had known one more
illustrious <i>than yours</i>, I should have taken it."</p>

<h4>CLXVI.&mdash;LORD CHESTERFIELD.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lord Chesterfield was in administration, he proposed a person to
his late majesty as proper to fill a place of great trust, but which the
king himself was determined should be filled by another. The council,
however, resolved not to indulge the king, for fear of a dangerous
precedent, and it was Lord Chesterfield's business to present the grant
of office for the king's signature. Not to incense his majesty by asking
him abruptly, he, with accents of great humility, begged to know with
whose name his majesty would be pleased to have the blanks filled up.
"With the <i>devil's</i>!" replied the king, in a paroxysm of rage. "And
shall the instrument," said the Earl, coolly, "run as usual, <i>Our trusty
and well-beloved cousin and counsellor</i>?"&mdash;a repartee at which the king
laughed heartily, and with great good-humor signed the grant.</p>

<h4>CLXVII.&mdash;SPECIAL PLEADING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a very eminent special pleader was asked by a country gentleman if
he considered that his son was likely to succeed as a special pleader,

<h4>CLXIX.&mdash;THE ZODIAC CLUB.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the occasion of starting a convivial club, somebody proposed that it
should consist of twelve members, and be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> called "The Zodiac," each
member to be named after a sign.</p>

<p>"And what shall I be?" inquired a somewhat solemn man, who was afraid
that his name would be forgotten.</p>

<p><i>Jerrold.</i>&mdash;"Oh, we'll bring you in as the <i>weight</i> in Libra."</p>

<h4>CLXXI.&mdash;STRIKING REPROOF.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> being reported that Lady Caroline Lamb had, in a moment of passion,
knocked down one of her pages with a stool, the poet Moore, to whom this
was told by Lord Strangford, observed: "Oh! nothing is more natural for
a literary lady than to double down a page."&mdash;"I would rather," replied
his lordship, "advise Caroline to <i>turn over a new leaf</i>."</p>

<h4>CLXXII.&mdash;A PRETTY PICTURE.</h4>

<p>E&mdash;&mdash; taking the portrait of a lady, perceived that when he was working
at her mouth she was trying to render it smaller by contracting her
lips. "Do not trouble yourself so much, madam," exclaimed the painter;
"if you please, I will draw your face <i>without any mouth</i> at all."</p>

<h4>CLXXIII.&mdash;UNKNOWN TONGUE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the long French war, two old ladies in Stranraer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> were going to
the kirk, the one said to the other, "Was it no a wonderfu' thing that
the Breetish were aye victorious ower the French in battle?"&mdash;"Not a
bit," said the other old lady, "dinna ye ken the Breetish aye say their
prayers before ga'in into battle?" The other replied, "But canna the
French say their prayers as weel?" The reply was most characteristic,
"Hoot! jabbering bodies, wha could <i>understan'</i> them?"</p>

<h4>CLXXIV.&mdash;DUNNING AND LORD MANSFIELD.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> the celebrated Mr. Dunning, afterwards Lord Ashburton, was at the
bar, he by his conduct did much to support the character and dignity of
a barrister, which was frequently disregarded by Lord Mansfield, at that
time Chief Justice. The attempts of the Chief Justice to brow-beat the
counsel were on many occasions kept in check by the manly and dignified
conduct of Mr. Dunning. Lord Mansfield possessed great quickness in
discovering the gist of a cause, and having done so, used to amuse
himself by taking up a book or a newspaper, whilst counsel was
addressing the court. Whenever Mr. Dunning was speaking, and his
Lordship seemed thus to hold his argument as of no consequence, the
advocate would stop suddenly in his address, and on his Lordship
observing, "Pray go on, Mr. Dunning," he would reply, "I beg your
pardon, my Lord, but I fear I shall interrupt your Lordship's <i>more
important</i> occupations. I will wait until your Lordship has leisure to
attend to my client and his humble advocate."</p>

<h4>CLXXVI.&mdash;CHANGING HIS LINE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span>, inquiring of Jack Bannister respecting a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> man who had been
hanged, was told that he was dead. "And did he continue in the <i>grocery
line</i>?" said the former. "Oh no," replied Jack; "he was quite in a
<i>different line</i> when he died."</p>

<h4>CLXXVII.&mdash;TALL AND SHORT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> an evening party, Jerrold was looking at the dancers. Seeing a very
tall gentleman waltzing with a remarkably short lady, he said to a
friend at hand, "Humph! there's the mile dancing with the mile-stone."</p>

<h4>CLXXVIII.&mdash;AN ODD COMPARISON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir William B&mdash;&mdash;</span> being at a parish meeting, made some proposals, which
were objected to by a farmer. Highly enraged, "Sir," says he to the
farmer, "do you know, sir, that I have been at the two universities, and
at two colleges in each university?"&mdash;"Well, sir," said the farmer,
"what of that? I had a calf that sucked two cows, and the observation I
made was, the more he sucked, the greater <i>calf</i> he grew."</p>

<h4>CLXXIX.&mdash;ON THE RIGHT SIDE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was said of one that remembered everything that he lent, but nothing
that he borrowed, "that he had <i>lost half</i> of his memory."</p>

<h4>CLXXX.&mdash;CAUSE OF ABSENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the late Lord Campbell married Miss Scarlett, and departed on his
wedding trip, Mr. Justice Abbott observed, when a cause was called on in
the Bench, "I thought, Mr. Brougham, that Mr. Campbell was in this
case?"&mdash;"Yes, my lord," replied Brougham, "but I understand he is
ill&mdash;suffering from <i>Scarlett fever</i>."</p>

<h4>CLXXXI.&mdash;THE SCOLD'S VOCABULARY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> copiousness of the English language perhaps was never more apparent
than in the following character, by a lady, of her own husband:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is," says she, "an abhorred, barbarous, capricious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> detestable,

suspicious, treacherous, troublesome, turbulent, tyrannical, virulent,
wrangling, yelping dog-in-a-manger."</p>

<h4>CLXXXII.&mdash;A FAMILIAR ILLUSTRATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A medical</span> student under examination, being asked the different effects
of heat and cold, replied: "Heat expands and cold contracts."&mdash;"Quite
right; can you give me an example?"&mdash;"Yes, sir, in summer, which is hot,
the days are longer; but in winter, which is <i>cold</i>, the days are
<i>shorter</i>."</p>

<h4>CLXXXIII.&mdash;HAPPINESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Happiness</span> grows at our own firesides, and is not to be picked in
strangers' gardens.</p>

<h4>CLXXXIV.&mdash;TRANSPOSING A COMPLIMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was said of a work (which had been inspected by a severe critic), in
terms which at first appeared very flattering, "There is a great deal in
this book which is new, and a great deal that is true." So far good, the
author would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> think; but then came the negation: "But it unfortunately
happens, that those portions which are <i>new</i> are not <i>true</i>, and those
which are <i>true</i> are not <i>new</i>!"</p>

<h4>CLXXXV.&mdash;A HANDSOME CONTRIBUTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> waited upon Jerrold one morning to enlist his sympathies in
behalf of a mutual friend, who was constantly in want of a round sum of
money.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jerrold, who had contributed on former occasions, "how much
does &mdash;&mdash; want this time?"</p>

<p>"Why, just a four and two noughts will, I think, put him straight," the
bearer of the hat replied.</p>

<p><i>Jerrold.</i>&mdash;"Well, put me down for one of the noughts this time."</p>

<h4>CLXXXVI.&mdash;WASTE OF TIME.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old man of ninety having recovered from a very dangerous illness, his
friends congratulated him, and encouraged him to get up. "Alas!" said he
to them, "it is hardly worth while to <i>dress</i> myself again."</p>

<h4>CLXXXVII.&mdash;SCOTCH SIMPLICITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Hawick, the people used to wear wooden clogs, which made a <i>clanking</i>
noise on the pavement. A dying old woman had some friends by her
bedside, who said to her, "Weel, Jenny, ye are gaun to Heeven, an' gin
you should see our folks, ye can tell them that we're a weel." To which
Jenny replied. "Weel, gin I shud see them I 'se tell them, but you manna
expect that I am to gang clank clanking through Heeven looking for your
folk."</p>

<h4>CLXXXVIII.&mdash;TWOFOLD ILLUSTRATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Fletcher Norton</span> was noted for his want of courtesy. When pleading
before Lord Mansfield on some question of manorial right, he chanced
unfortunately to say, "My lord, I can illustrate the point in an instant
in my own person: I myself have two little manors." The judge
immediately interposed, with one of his blandest smiles, "We all <i>know</i>
it, Sir Fletcher."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<h4>CLXXXIX.&mdash;NAT LEE AND SIR ROGER L'ESTRANGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> author of "Alexander the Great," whilst confined in a madhouse, was
visited by Sir Roger L'Estrange, of whose political abilities Lee
entertained no very high opinion. Upon the knight inquiring whether the
poet knew him, Lee answered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Custom may alter men, and manners change:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I am still <i>strange Lee</i>, and you L'Estrange:<br /></span>

</div></div>

<h4>CXC.&mdash;MAIDS AND WIVES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Women</span> are all alike. When they're maids they're mild as milk: once make
'em wives, and they lean their backs against their marriage
certificates, and defy you.&mdash;D.J.</p>

<h4>CXCI.&mdash;TRAGEDY MS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Liston</span>, seeing a parcel lying on the table in the entrance-hall of Drury
Lane Theatre, one side of which, from its having travelled to town by
the side of some game, was smeared with blood, observed, "That parcel
contains a manuscript tragedy." And on being asked why, replied,
"Because the <i>fifth</i> act is peeping out at one corner of it."</p>

<h4>CXCII.&mdash;A TRUE COURTIER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day, when Sir Isaac Heard was in company with George III., it was
announced that his majesty's horse was ready for hunting. "Sir Isaac,"
said the king, "are you a judge of horses?"&mdash;"In my younger days, please
your majesty, I was a great deal among them," was the reply. "What do
you think of this, then?" said the king, who was by this time preparing
to mount his favorite: and, without waiting for an answer, added, "we
call him. <i>Perfection</i>."&mdash;"A most appropriate name," replied the courtly
herald, bowing as his majesty reached the saddle, "for he <i>bears</i> the
best of characters."</p>

<h4>CXCIII.&mdash;RARE VIRTUE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> paucity of some persons' good actions reminds one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> of Jonathan Wild,
who was once induced to be guilty of a good action, after fully
satisfying himself, upon the maturest deliberation, that he could <i>gain
nothing</i> by refraining from it.</p>

<h4>CXCIV.&mdash;A POSER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A coxcomb</span> in a coffee-house boasted that he had written a certain
popular song, just as the true author entered the room. A friend of his
pointed to the coxcomb: "See, sir, the real author of your favorite
song."&mdash;"Well," replied the other, "the gentleman <i>might</i> have made it,
for I assure him I found no difficulty in doing it myself."</p>

<h4>CXCV.&mdash;A SHEEPISH COMPLIMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cockburn</span>, the proprietor of Bonaly, was sitting on the hillside
with a shepherd, and, observing the sheep reposing in the coldest
situation, he remarked to him, "John, if I were a sheep, I would lie on
the other side of the hill." The shepherd answered, "Ah, my lord, but if
ye had been a <i>sheep</i> ye would hae had mair sense."</p>

<h4>CXCVI.&mdash;CONSIDERABLE LATITUDE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Richard Jebb</span> being called to see a patient who fancied himself very
ill, told him ingenuously what he thought, and declined prescribing for
him. "Now you are here," said the patient, "I shall be obliged to you,
Sir Richard, if you will tell me how I must live; what I may eat, and
what I may not."&mdash;"My directions as to that point," replied Sir Richard,
"will be few and simple! You must not eat the poker, shovel, or tongs,
for they are hard of digestion; nor the bellows, because they are
<i>windy</i>; but eat anything else you please!"</p>

<h4>CXCVII.&mdash;FARMER AND ATTORNEY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> opulent farmer applied to an attorney about a lawsuit, but was told
he could not undertake it, being already engaged on the other side; at
the same time he gave him a letter of recommendation to a professional
friend. The farmer, out of curiosity, opened it, and read as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here are two fat wethers fallen out together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you'll fleece one, I'll fleece the other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make 'em agree like brother and brother."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The perusal of this epistle cured both parties, and terminated the
dispute.</p>

<h4>CXCVIII.&mdash;A WIFE AT FORTY.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> notion of a wife at forty," said Jerrold, "is, that a man should be
able to change her, like a bank-note, for two twenties."</p>

<h4>CXCIX.&mdash;DISAPPROBATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> actor played a season at Richmond theatre for the privilege only of
having a benefit. When his night came, and having to sustain a principal
part in the piece, the whole of his audience (thirty in number), hissed
him whenever he appeared. When the piece ended, he came forward and
said, "Ladies and gentlemen, I return you my sincere thanks for your
kindness, but when you mean to hiss me again on my benefit night, I hope
you will be at least <i>six times</i> as many as are here to-night."</p>

<h4>CC.&mdash;NOVEL OFFENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Cooke</span> and Dibdin went, at a tolerably steady quick-step, as far as the
middle of Greek Street, when Cooke, who had passed his hand along all
the palisades and shutters as he marched, came in contact with the
recently-painted new front of a coachmaker's shop, from which he
obtained a complete handful of wet color. Without any explanation as to
the cause of his anger, he rushed suddenly into the middle of the
street, and raised a stone to hurl against the unoffending windows; but
Dibdin was in time to save them from destruction, and him from the
watch-house. On being asked the cause of his hostility to the premises
of a man who could not have offended him, he replied, with a hiccup,
"what! not offend? A &mdash;&mdash; ignorant coachmaker, to leave his <i>house out</i>,
new-painted, at this time of night!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<h4>CCI.&mdash;MEASURING HIS DISTANCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A browbeating</span> counsel asked a witness how far he had been from a certain
place. "Just four yards, two feet, and six inches," was the reply. "How
came you to be so exact, my friend?"&mdash;"Because I expected <i>some fool</i> or
other would ask me, and so I measured it."</p>

<h4>CCII.&mdash;VERY CLEAR.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> is light?" asked a schoolmaster of the booby of a class. "A
sovereign that isn't full weight is light," was the prompt reply.</p>

<h4>CCIII.&mdash;BROTHERLY LOVE.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Ah!</span>" said a conceited young parson, "I have this afternoon been
preaching to a congregation of asses."&mdash;"Then that was the reason why
you always called them <i>beloved brethren</i>," replied a strong-minded
lady.</p>

<h4>CCIV.&mdash;EPIGRAM.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="smcap">A stupid</span> fellow employed in blowing a cathedral organ, said after the
performance of a fine anthem, "I think we performed very well
to-day."&mdash;"<i>We</i> performed!" answered the organist; "I think it was <i>I</i>
performed, or I am much mistaken." Shortly after another celebrated
piece of music was to be played. In the middle of the anthem the organ
stopped; the organist cried out in a passion, "Why don't you blow?" The
fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> popped out his head from behind the organ, and said, "Shall it

dog</i>."</p>

that can afford to be ill? Now, I will inform you," said he, "how I
manage my physicians. I have four, to whom the care of my health is

nose</i> was betwixt them."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mr. Sheridan pleaded in court his own cause, and that of the Drury
Lane Theatre, an Irish laborer, known amongst the actors by the name of
Billy Brown, was called upon to give his evidence. Previous to his going
into court, the counsellor, shocked at the shabby dress of the witness,
began to remonstrate with him on this point: "You should have put on
your Sunday clothes, and not think of coming into court covered with
lime and brick-dust; it detracts from the credit of your
evidence."&mdash;"<i>Be cool, Mr. Counsellor</i>," said Billy, "<i>only be cool,
you're in your working-dress, and I am in mine; and that's that</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

go home and make your will, or, if you have made it, put a codicil to
it, and direct your executors, as soon as you are dead, to have you
flayed, and to have your skin made into side-saddles, and then, whatever
happens, you will have the satisfaction of reflecting that, after death,
some part of you will be constantly in contact with what, in life, were
the <i>dearest objects</i> of your affections."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A remarkably</span> ugly and disagreeable man sat opposite Jerrold at a
dinner-party. Before the cloth was removed, Jerrold accidentally broke a
glass. Whereupon the ugly gentleman, thinking to twit his opposite

<p><span class="smcap">Bubb Doddington</span> was very lethargic. Falling asleep one day, after dinner
with Sir Richard Temple and Lord Cobham, the latter reproached
Doddington with his drowsiness. Doddington denied having been asleep;
and to prove he had not, offered to repeat all Lord Cobham had been
saying. Cobham challenged him to do so. Doddington repeated a story; and
Lord Cobham owned he had been telling it. "Well," said Doddington, "and

<h4>CCXLIV.&mdash;A FAIR REPULSE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of the threatened invasion, the laird of Logan had been
taunted at a meeting at Ayr with want of a loyal spirit at Cumnock, as
at that place no volunteer corps had been raised to meet the coming

and ten or twelve miles from the coast. "What sort of people are you, up

seeming civility, requested "that when he saw or heard anything that was
entertaining on the stage, to let him and the gentleman with him know of
it, as at present we must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> totally depend on <i>your kindness</i>." This had

100l."&mdash;"True," said his lordship, "I did so; but you know, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
that I am now making arrangements with all my creditors <i>at 5s. in the

coat."&mdash;"Your coat, my dear fellow," said Brummell: "what coat?"&mdash;"Why,
<i>this</i> coat," said Leinster; "this coat that I have on." Brummell, after

of Chatham, his lordship asked him how he defined wit. "My lord," said
the doctor, "wit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> is like what a pension would be, given by your

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Do you," said Fanny, t' other day,<br /></span>

then you must have been firing at a <i>wig</i>."</p>

<h4>CCC.&mdash;AN UNRE-HEARSED EFFECT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A noble</span> lord, not over courageous, was once so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> engaged in an affair
of honor, as to be drawn to Hyde Park to fight a duel. But just as he
arrived at the Porter's Lodge, an empty <i>hearse</i> came by; on which his
lordship's antagonist called out to the driver, "Stop here, my good
fellow, a few minutes, and I'll send <i>you a fare</i>." This operated so
strongly on his lordship's nerves, that he begged his opponent's pardon,
and returned home in a whole skin.</p>

<h4>CCCI.&mdash;A GOOD SERVANT.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I can't</span> conceive," said one nobleman to another, "how it is that you

place?"&mdash;"<i>I am my own steward</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> asked a very silly Scotch nobleman, how it happened that the
Scots who came out of their own country were, generally speaking, men of
more abilities than those who remained at home. "O madam," said he, "the
reason is obvious. At every outlet there are persons stationed to
examine all who pass, that, for the honor of the country, no one be
permitted to leave it who is not a man of understanding."&mdash;"Then," said
she, "I suppose your lordship was <i>smuggled</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<h4>CCCVIII.&mdash;CONTRABAND SCOTCHMAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> was complimenting Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; on her acting a certain female

gentleman, "you are a complete proof of the <i>contrary</i>."</p>

<h4>CCCIX.&mdash;A PLACEBO.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mr. Canning was about giving up Gloucester Lodge, Brompton, he said
to his gardener, as he took a farewell look of the grounds, "I am sorry,

fret; when you had this <i>old</i> place, you were <i>out</i> of place; now you

<h4>CCCXI.&mdash;NOT TO BE BOUGHT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A common-councilman's</span> lady paying her daughter a visit at school, and
inquiring what progress she had made in her education, the governess
answered, "pretty good, madam, she is very attentive: if she wants
anything it is a <i>capacity</i>: but for <i>that</i> deficiency you know we must
not blame <i>her</i>."&mdash;"No madam," replied the mother, "but I blame <i>you</i>
for not having mentioned it before. Her father can afford his daughter a
<i>capacity</i>; and I beg she may have one immediately, cost what it may."</p>

<h4>CCCXII.&mdash;SIGN OF BEING CRACKED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a cause respecting a will, evidence was given to prove the testatrix,
an apothecary's widow, a lunatic; amongst other things, it was deposed
that she had swept a quantity of pots, lotions, potions, &amp;c., into the
street as rubbish. "I doubt," said the learned judge, "whether sweeping
<i>physic</i> into the street be any proof of insanity."&mdash;"True, my lord,"
replied the counsel, "but sweeping the <i>pots</i> away, certainly was."</p>

<h4>CCCXIII.&mdash;CRUEL SUGGESTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Stanley</span> came plainly dressed to request a private audience of King
James I., but was refused admittance into the royal closet by a

between the two, came out and inquired the cause. "My liege," said Lord
Stanley, "this gay countryman of yours has refused me admittance to your
presence."&mdash;"Cousin," said the king, "how shall I punish him? Shall I
send him to the Tower?"&mdash;"O no, my liege," replied Lord Stanley,
"inflict a severer punishment,&mdash;<i>send him back to Scotland</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Willoughby de Broke</span> was a very singular character,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> and had more
peculiarities than any nobleman of his day. Coming once out of the House
of Peers, and not seeing his servant among those who were waiting at the

near him, "<i>not in Europe</i>."</p>

<h4>CCCXV.&mdash;POST-MORTEM.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of Cromwell's granddaughters was remarkable for her vivacity and
humor. One summer, being in company at Tunbridge Wells, a gentleman

madam; you know your grandfather was hanged."&mdash;To which she instantly
replied, "But not till he was <i>dead</i>."</p>

<h4>CCCXVI.&mdash;KNOWING HIS PLACE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a grand review by George III. of the Portsmouth fleet in 1789, there

rejoined the father.</p>

<h4>CCCXVIII.&mdash;CUTTING ON BOTH SIDES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord B&mdash;&mdash;</span>, who sported a ferocious pair of whiskers, meeting Mr.
O'Connell in Dublin, the latter said, "When do you mean to place your
whiskers on the <i>peace establishment</i>?"&mdash;"When you place your tongue on
the <i>civil list</i>!" was the rejoinder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<h4>CCCXIX.&mdash;A READY RECKONER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A mathematician</span> being asked by a wag, "If a pig weighs 200 pounds, how

<h4>CCCXXIII.&mdash;HINC ILLE LACHRYM&AElig;.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> mortality among Byron's mistresses," said the late Lady A&mdash;&mdash;ll,
"is really alarming. I think he generally buries, in verse, a first love
every fortnight."&mdash;"Madam," replied Curran, "mistresses are not so
mortal. The fact is, my lord weeps for the <i>press</i>, and wipes his eyes
with <i>the public</i>."</p>

<h4>CCCXXIV.&mdash;REASON FOR GOING TO CHURCH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was observed of an old citizen that he was the most regular man in
London in his attendance at church, and no man in the kingdom was more
punctual in his prayers. "He has a very good reason for it," replied
John Wilkes, "for, as he never gave a shilling, did a kindness, or
conferred a favor on any man living, <i>no one would pray for him</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

Nottingham on suspicion of having treasonable papers in his possession.

roughly-sketched play." The Earl examined the papers, however, and then
returned them, saying, "I have heard your statement and read your play,
and as I can find <i>no trace</i> of <i>a plot</i> in either, you may go free."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson</span> was observed by a musical friend of his to be extremely
inattentive at a concert, whilst a celebrated solo player was running up

extremely difficult it was. "Difficult, do you call it, sir?" replied
the doctor; "I wish it were <i>impossible</i>."</p>

<h4>CCCXXIX.&mdash;MR. CANNING'S PARASITES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Nature</span> descends down to infinite smallness. Mr. Canning has his

it in a microscope, you may see twenty or thirty little ugly insects
crawling about it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> which doubtless think their fly to be the bluest,
grandest, merriest, most important animal in the universe, and are

<h4>CCCXXXIII.&mdash;WIGNELL THE ACTOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of old Mr. Sheridan's favorite characters was <i>Cato</i>: and on its
revival at Covent Garden Theatre, a Mr. Wignell assumed his
old-established part of <i>Portius</i>; and having stepped forward with a
prodigious though accustomed strut, began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The dawn is overcast; the morning lowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heavily, in clouds, brings on the day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The audience upon this began to vociferate "Prologue! prologue!
prologue!" when Wignell, finding them resolute, without betraying any
emotion, pause, or change in his voice and manner, proceeded as if it
were part of the play:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ladies and gentlemen, there has been no<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prologue spoken to this play these twenty years&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great, the important day, big with the fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cato and of Rome."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This wonderful effusion put the audience in good humor: they laughed
immoderately, clapped, and shouted "<i>Bravo</i>!" and Wignell still
continued with his usual composure and stateliness.</p>

<h4>CCCXXXIV.&mdash;CANDOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A notorious</span> egotist, indirectly praising himself for a number of good
qualities which it was well known he had not, asked Macklin the reason
why he should have this propensity of interfering in the good of others
when he frequently met with very unsuitable returns. "The cause is plain
enough," said Macklin; "<i>impudence</i>,&mdash;nothing but stark-staring
impudence!"</p>

<h4>CCCXXXV.&mdash;A "COLD" COMPLIMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A coxcomb</span>, teasing Dr. Parr with an account of his petty ailments,
complained that he could never go out without catching cold in his head.
"No wonder," returned the doctor; "you always go out without <i>anything</i>
in it."</p>

<h4>CCCXXXVI.&mdash;READY REPLY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> grass-plots in the college courts or quadrangles are not for the
unhallowed feet of the under-graduates. Some, however, are hardy enough
to venture, in despite of all remonstrance. A master of Trinity had
often observed a student of his college invariably to cross the green,
when, in obedience to the calls of his appetite, he went to hall to
dine. One day the master determined to reprove the delinquent for
invading the rights of his superiors, and for that purpose he threw up
the sash at which he was sitting, and called to the student,&mdash;"Sir, I
never look out of my window but I see you walking across the
grass-plot". "My lord," replied the offender instantly, "I never walk
across the grass-plot, but I <i>see you</i> looking out of your window." The
master, pleased at the readiness of the reply, closed his window,
convulsed with laughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<h4>CCCXXXVII.&mdash;FULL PROOF.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Peterborough</span> was once taken by the mob for the great Duke of
Marlborough (who was then in disgrace with them); and being about to be
roughly treated, said,&mdash;"Gentlemen, I can convince you by two reasons
that I am not the Duke of Marlborough. In the first place, I have only
<i>five guineas</i> in my pocket; and in the second, they are heartily at
your service." He got out of their hands with loud huzzas and
acclamations.</p>

<h4>CCCXXXVIII.&mdash;EPIGRAM ON CIBBER.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">In</span> merry Old England it once was the rule,<br /></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Roger Long</span>, the celebrated astronomer, was walking, one dark

"Get out of the way, boy."&mdash;"That boy," said the doctor, very seriously,
"is a <i>post-boy</i>, who never turns out of the way for anybody."</p>

<h4>CCCXLI.&mdash;FAMILY PRIDE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> lady visiting in the family asked John at dinner for a potato.

and they maun be <i>keepit</i> for the strangers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<h4>CCCXLII.&mdash;EVIDENCE OF A JOCKEY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following dialogue was lately heard at an assize:&mdash;Counsel: "What

Witness: "Sixteen hands." Counsel: "You said just now sixteen <i>feet</i>."

engagement for himself and his wife, stating that his lady was capable
of playing all the first line of business; but as for himself he was
"the worst actor in the world." They were engaged, and the lady answered
the character which he had given of her. The gentleman having the part
of a mere walking gentleman sent him for his first appearance, he asked
the manager, indignantly, how could he put him in such a paltry part.
"Sir," answered the other, "here is your own letter, stating that you
were the <i>worst</i> actor in the world."&mdash;"True," replied the other, "but

<h4>CCCXLVII.&mdash;CAMBRIDGE ETIQUETTE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Cambridge</span> etiquette has been very happily caricatured by the following
anecdote. A gownsman, one day walking along the banks of the Cam,
observing a luckless son of his Alma Mater in the agonies of <i>drowning</i>,
"What a pity," he exclaimed, "that I have not had the honor of being

warrant you;" but in half-a-dozen steps the horse sunk up to the girths.
"You story-telling rascal, you said it was hard at the bottom!"&mdash;"Ay,"
replied the other, "but you are not <i>half-way</i> to the bottom yet."</p>

<h4>CCCL.&mdash;SELF-KNOWLEDGE.</h4>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;," said one of his eulogists, "always knows his own mind." We will

the third day, Jewel, his treasurer, calling in upon him, he asked him,
with swollen eyes, what time would the burial be? "Not till next week,
sir," replied the other, "as I hear the surgeons are first to dissect
his head." This last word restored Foote's fancy, and, repeating it with

swallowed, and the landlord handed his customer a biscuit. "Well, no, I
think not," said the customer; "you sell 'em too dear. I can get lots of
'em <i>five or six</i> for a penny anywhere else."</p>

<h4>CDXLVI.&mdash;A REFLECTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> overbearing barrister, endeavoring to brow-beat a witness, told him

<h4>CDXLVII.&mdash;FOOTE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> artist named Forfeit, having some job to do for Foote, got into a
foolish scrape about <i>the antiquity of family</i> with another artist, who
gave him such a drubbing as confined him to his bed for a considerable
time. "Forfeit! Forfeit!" said Foote, "why, surely you have the best of
the argument; your family is not only <i>several thousand years old</i>, but
at the same time <i>the most numerous</i> of any on the face of the globe, on
the authority of Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<h4>CDL.&mdash;PROFITABLE JUGGLING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A professor</span> of legerdemain entertained an audience in a village, which
was principally composed of colliers. After "astonishing the natives"
with various tricks, he asked the loan of a halfpenny. A collier, with a
little hesitation, handed out the coin, which the juggler speedily
exhibited, as he said, transformed into a sovereign. "An' is that my
bawbee?" exclaimed the collier. "Undoubtedly," answered the juggler.
"Let's see 't," said the collier; and turning it round and round with an
ecstasy of delight, thanked the juggler for his kindness, and putting it
into his pocket, said, "I'se war'nt ye'll <i>no turn't</i> into a bawbee
again."</p>

<h4>CDLI.&mdash;PICKPOCKETING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Baron de B&eacute;ranger relates, that, having secured a pickpocket in the
very act of irregular abstraction, he took the liberty of inquiring
whether there was anything in his face that had procured him the honor
of being singled out for such an attempt. "Why, sir," said the fellow,
"your face is well enough, but you had on thin shoes and white stockings
in dirty weather, and so I made sure you were a <i>flat</i>."</p>

<h4>CDLII.&mdash;DUNNING AND LORD THURLOW.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> it was the custom for barristers to leave chambers early, and to
finish their evenings at the coffee-houses in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> the neighborhood of the
inns of court, Lord Thurlow on some occasion wanted to see Dunning
privately. He went to the coffee-house frequented by him, and asked a
waiter if Mr. Dunning was there. The waiter, who was new in his place,
said he did not know him. "Not know him!" exclaimed Thurlow, with his
usual oaths; "go into the room up stairs, and if you see any gentleman
<i>like the knave of clubs</i>, tell him he is particularly wanted." The
waiter went up, and forthwith reappeared followed by Dunning.</p>

<h4>CDLIII.&mdash;AFFECTATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> people were talking with Jerrold about a gentleman as celebrated
for the intensity as for the shortness of his friendships.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jerrold, "his friendships are so warm that he no sooner
takes them up than he puts them down again."</p>

<h4>CDLV.&mdash;THEATRICAL MISTAKES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A laughable</span> blunder was made by Mrs. Gibbs, at Covent Garden Theatre, in
the season of 1823, in the part of <i>Miss Stirling</i>, in "The Clandestine
Marriage." When speaking of the conduct of <i>Betty</i>, who had locked the
door of <i>Miss Fanny's</i> room, and walked away with the key, Mrs. G. said,
"<i>She had locked the key, and carried away the door in her pocket</i>."
Mrs. Davenport, as <i>Mrs. Heidelberg</i>, had previously excited a hearty
laugh, by substituting for the original dialogue, "<i>I protest there's a
candle coming along the gallery with a man in his hand</i>;" but the
mistake by Mrs. Gibbs seemed to be so unintentional, so unpremeditated,
that the effect was irresistible; and the audience, celebrated the joke
with three rounds of applause.</p>

<h4>CDLVI.&mdash;A BROKEN HEAD.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I am</span> the only man in Europe, sir," said the Colonel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> "that ever had a
broken head,&mdash;to live after it. I was hunting near my place in
Yorkshire; my horse threw me, and I was pitched, head-foremost, upon a
scythe which had been left upon the ground. When I was taken up my head
was found to be literally cut in two, and was spread over my shoulders
like a pair of epaulettes. <i>That</i> was a broken head, if you please,
sir."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Counsellor M&mdash;&mdash;t</span>, after he retired from practice, being one day in
company where the uncertainty of the law became the topic of
conversation, was applied to for his opinion, upon which he laconically
observed, "If any man were to claim the <i>coat</i> upon my back, and
threaten my refusal with a lawsuit, he should certainly have it, lest in
defending my <i>coat</i> I should too late find that I was deprived of my
<i>waistcoat</i> also."</p>

<h4>CDLXI.&mdash;UNREMITTING KINDNESS.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Call</span> that a kind man," said an actor, speaking of an absent
acquaintance; "a man who is away from his family, and never sends them a
farthing! Call that kindness?"</p>

<p>"Yes, unremitting kindness," Jerrold replied.</p>

<h4>CDLXII.&mdash;KEAN'S IMPROMPTU.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Birmingham, one of Kean's "benefits" was a total failure. In the last
scene of the play ("A New Way to pay Old Debts"), wherein allusion is

disposition, but one who was not overburdened with sense. The latter

head."&mdash;"I accept it," said Congreve; "for <i>trifles</i> show respect."</p>

<h4>CDLXV.&mdash;A GRETNA CUSTOMER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A runaway</span> couple were married at Gretna Green. The smith demanded five
guineas for his services. "How is this?" said the bridegroom, "the
gentleman you last married assured me that he only gave you a
guinea."&mdash;"True," said the smith, "but <i>he</i> was an Irishman. I have
married him six times. <i>He is a good customer</i>, and <i>you</i> I may never
see again."</p>

<h4>CDLXVI.&mdash;LEAVING HIS VERDICT.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I remember</span>," says Lord Biden, "Mr. Justice Gould trying a case at York,

</div></div>

<p>To which he gave the proper sense,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am not <i>over-wise</i>;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but pausing as if he doubted its correctness,&mdash;"<i>You</i> are quite right,

<p><span class="smcap">Jemmy Gordon</span>, the Cambridge eccentric, when he happened to be without
shoes or stockings, one day came in contact with a person of very

in <i>your shoes</i> for all the world!"</p>

<h4>CDLXXI.&mdash;BLACK LETTER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old friend of Charles Lamb having been in vain trying to make out a

<h4>CDLXXV.&mdash;VERY PRETTY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day, just as an English officer had arrived at Vienna, the empress

<h4>CDLXXVIII.&mdash;"I'VE DONE THE SAME THING OFTEN."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Mr. John Smith</span>, who is described, evidently not without reason, as a
"fast" talker, gave the following description of the blowing up of a
steamboat on the Mississippi: "I had landed at Helena for a minute to
drop some letters into the post-office, when all of a sudden I heard a
tremendous explosion, and, looking up, saw that the sky was for a minute
darkened with arms, legs, and other small bits and scraps of my
fellow-travellers. Amongst an uncommonly ugly medley, I spied the second
clerk, about one hundred and fifty feet above my own level. I recognized
him at once, for ten minutes before I had been sucking a sherry-cobbler
with him out of the same rummer. Well, I watched him. He came down
through the roof of a shoemaker's shop, and landed on the floor close by
the shoemaker, who was at work. The clerk, being in a hurry, jumped up
to go to the assistance of the other sufferers, when the 'man of wax'
demanded five hundred dollars for the damage done to his roof. 'Too
high,' replied the clerk; 'never paid more than two hundred and fifty
dollars in my life, <i>and I've done the same thing often</i>.'"</p>

<h4>CDLXXIX.&mdash;CONFIDENCE.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Why</span>," said a country clergyman to one of his flock, "do you always
sleep in your pew when I am in the pulpit, while you are all attention
to every stranger I invite?"&mdash;"Because, sir," was the reply, "when <i>you</i>
preach I'm sure all's right, but I can't trust <i>a stranger</i> without
keeping a good look-out."</p>

<h4>CDLXXX.&mdash;THE CUT INFERNAL.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h4>CDLXXXI.&mdash;FEELING HIS WAY.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Uncle</span>," said a young man (who thought that his guardian supplied him
rather sparingly with pocket-money),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> "is the Queen's head <i>still</i> on
the sovereign?"&mdash;"Of course it is, you stupid lad! Why do you ask
that?"&mdash;"Because it is now such a length of time since <i>I saw one</i>."</p>

<span class="i0">Since he married, poor man, he'd <i>no will of his own</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>CDLXXXIII.&mdash;INGENUOUSNESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> young officers, after a mess-dinner, had very much ridiculed their
general. He sent for them, and asked them if what was reported to him
was true. "General," said one of them, "<i>it is</i>; and we should have said
much more if our <i>wine</i> had not failed."</p>

<h4>CDLXXXIV.&mdash;A NEW SPORT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Quin</span> thought angling a very barbarous diversion; and on being asked why,
gave this reason: "Suppose some superior being should bait a hook with
venison, and go a-<i>Quinning</i>, I should certainly bite; and what a sight
should I be dangling in the air!"</p>

<h4>CDLXXXV.&mdash;SYDNEY SMITH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney Smith</span> was once dining in company with a French gentleman, who had
been before dinner indulging in a number of free-thinking speculations,
and had ended by avowing himself a materialist. "Very good soup, this,"

<h4>CDLXXXVII.&mdash;A FAIR PROPOSAL.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Why</span> don't you take off your hat?" said Lord F&mdash;&mdash; to a boy struggling
with a calf. "So I wull, sir," replied the lad; "if your lordship will
<i>hold</i> my calf, I'll pull off my hat."</p>

<h4>CDLXXXVIII.&mdash;A DOUBTFUL CREED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Maule</span>, in summing up a case of libel, and speaking of a defendant
who had exhibited a spiteful piety, observed, "One of these defendants,
Mr. Blank, is, it seems, a minister of religion&mdash;of <i>what</i> religion does
not appear, but, to judge by his conduct, it cannot be any form of
Christianity." Severe.</p>

<h4>CDLXXXIX.&mdash;A SATISFACTORY TOTAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Scotch</span> Minister, after a hard day's labor, and while at a "denner
tea," as he called it, kept incessantly praising the "haam," and stating
that "Mrs. Dunlop at hame was as fond o' haam like that as he was," when
the mistress kindly offered to send her the present of a ham. "It's unco
kin' o' ye, unco kin', but I'll no pit ye to the trouble; I'll just tak'
it hame on the horse afore me." When, on leaving, he mounted, and the
ham was put into a sack, but some difficulty was experienced in getting
it to lie properly. His inventive genius soon cut the Gordian-knot. "I
think, mistress, <i>a cheese</i> in the ither en' wad mak' <i>a gran'
balance</i>." The hint was immediately acted on, and, like another John
Gilpin, he moved away with his "balance true."</p>

<h4>CDXC.&mdash;GOOD RIDDANCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> well-known provincial bore having left a tavern-party, of

<h4>CDXCII.&mdash;GEORGE II. AND THE RECORDER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> that vacancy happened on the Exchequer Bench which was afterwards
filled by Mr. Adams, the Ministry could not agree among themselves whom
to appoint. It was debated in Council, the King, George II., being
present; till, the dispute growing very warm, his Majesty put an end to
the contest by calling out, in broken English, "I will have none of
dese, give me the man wid de <i>dying speech</i>," meaning Mr. Adams, who was
then Recorder of London, and whose business it therefore was to make the
report to his Majesty of the convicts under sentence of death.</p>

<h4>CDXCIII.&mdash;SLEEPING ROUND.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> celebrated Quin had this faculty. "What sort of a morning is it,
John?"&mdash;"Very wet, sir."&mdash;"Any mullet in the market?"&mdash;"No,
sir."&mdash;"Then, John, you may call me this time to-morrow." So saying, he
composed himself to sleep, and got rid of the <i>ennui</i> of a dull day.</p>

<h4>CDXCIV.&mdash;AT HIS FINGERS' ENDS.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I suppose</span>," said a quack, while feeling the pulse of his patient, "that
you think me a <i>humbug</i>?"&mdash;"Sir," replied the sick man, "I perceive that
you can <i>discover</i> a man's thoughts by your touch."</p>

<h4>CDXCV.&mdash;NOT SO EASY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> learned serjeant, who is apt to be testy in argument, was
advised by the Court not to <i>show temper</i>, but to <i>show cause</i>.</p>

<h4>CDXCVI.&mdash;A POINT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Pope</span> was one evening at Button's coffee-house, where he and a set of
literati had got poring over a Latin manuscript, in which they had found
a passage that none of them could comprehend. A young officer, who heard
their conference, begged that he might be permitted to look at the
passage. "Oh," says Pope, sarcastically, "by all means; pray let the
young gentleman look at it." Upon which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> the officer took up the
manuscript, and, considering it a while, said there only wanted a note
of interrogation to make the whole intelligible: which was really the
case. "And pray, master," says Pope, with a sneer, "what is a <i>note of
interrogation</i>?"&mdash;"A note of interrogation," replied the young fellow,
with a look of great contempt, "is a little <i>crooked thing</i> that asks
questions."</p>

<h4>CDXCVII.&mdash;THE REPUBLIC OF LEARNING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> asked another why learning was always called a republic. "Forsooth,"
quoth the other, "because scholars are <i>so poor</i> that they have <i>not a
sovereign</i> amongst them."</p>

<h4>CDXCVIII.&mdash;CHALLENGING A JURY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> Irish fire-eater, previous to a trial in which he was the defendant,
was informed by his counsel, that if there were any of the jury to whom
he objected, he might legally <i>challenge</i> them. "Faith, and so I will,"
replied he; "if they do not acquit me I will <i>challenge</i> every man of
them."</p>

<h4>CDXCIX.&mdash;WALPOLIANA.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mr. Naylor's father married his second wife, Naylor said, "Father,
they say you are to be married to-day; are you?"&mdash;"Well," replied the
Bishop, "and what is that to you?"&mdash;"Nay, nothing; only if you had told
me, I would have <i>powdered</i> my hair."</p>

<p>A tutor at Cambridge had been examining some lads in Latin; but in a
little while excused himself, and said he must speak English, for his
mouth was <i>very sore</i>.</p>

<p>After going out of the Commons, and fighting a duel with Mr. Chetwynd,
whom he wounded, "my uncle" (says Walpole) "returned to the House, and
was so little moved as to speak immediately upon the <i>cambric bill</i>;"
which made Swinny say, that "it was a sign he was not <i>ruffled</i>."</p>

<h4>D.&mdash;MINDING HIS BUSINESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Murphy</span> was asked how it was so difficult to waken him in the morning:
"Indeed, master, it's because of taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> your own advice, always to
attind to what I'm about; so whenever I <i>sleeps</i>, I pays <i>attintion</i> to

<h4>DII.&mdash;SATISFACTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord William Poulat</span> was said to be the author of a pamphlet called "The
Snake in the Grass." A gentleman abused in it sent him a challenge. Lord
William protested his innocence, but the gentleman insisted upon a
denial under his own hand. Lord William took a pen and began: "This is
to scratify that the buk called 'The Snak'"&mdash;"Oh! my Lord," said the
person, "I am satisfied; your Lordship has already convinced me <i>you did
not</i> write the book."</p>

<h4>DIII.&mdash;A SAFE APPEAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A physician</span> once defended himself from raillery by saying, "I defy any
person whom I ever attended, to accuse me of ignorance or

doctor, <i>dead</i> men tell no tales."</p>

<h4>DIV.&mdash;A CAUTIOUS LOVER.</h4>

signed every letter to my love,&mdash;'Yours, without prejudice!'"&mdash;D.J.</p>

<h4>DV.&mdash;THE SWORD AND THE SCABBARD.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A wag</span>, on seeing his friend with something under his cloak, asked him
what it was. "A poniard," answered he; but he observed that it was a
bottle: taking it from him, and drinking the contents, he returned it,
saying, "There, I give you the <i>scabbard</i> back again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<h4>DVI.&mdash;TOUCHING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lord Eldon resigned the Great Seal, a small barrister said, "To me
his loss is irreparable. Lord Eldon always behaved to me like <i>a
father</i>."&mdash;"Yes," remarked Brougham, "I understand he always treated you
like <i>a child</i>."</p>

<h4>DVII.&mdash;THE COLLEGE BELL!</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a party of college grandees, one of the big-wigs proposed that each
gentleman should toast his favorite <i>Belle</i>. When it came to the turn of
Dr. Barrett (who happened to be one of the <i>quorum</i>) to be called on for
the name of the fair object of his admiration, he very facetiously gave,
"The College Bell!" <i>Vivat Collegium Sancti Petri</i>!</p>

<h4>DVIII.&mdash;FRENCH LANGUAGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> some one was expatiating on the merits of the French language to
Mr. Canning, he exclaimed: "Why, what on earth, sir, can be expected of
a language which has but one word for <i>liking</i> and <i>loving</i>, and puts a
fine woman and a leg of mutton on a par:&mdash;<i>J'aime Julie; J'aime un
gigot</i>!"</p>

<h4>DX.&mdash;CERTAINLY NOT ASLEEP.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A country</span> schoolmaster had two pupils, to one of whom he was partial,
and to the other severe. One morning it happened that these two boys
were late, and were called up to account for it. "You must have heard
the bell, boys; why did you not come?"&mdash;"Please, sir," said the
favorite, "I was dreaming that I was going to Margate, and I thought the
school-bell was the steamboat-bell."&mdash;"Very well," said the master, glad
of any pretext to excuse his favorite. "And now, sir," turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> to the
other, "what have you to say?"&mdash;"Please, sir," said the puzzled boy,
"<i>I&mdash;I&mdash;was waiting to see Tom off</i>!"</p>

<h4>DXI.&mdash;ANTICIPATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Avondale</span>, Chief Baron of the Exchequer, was much given to
anticipation. A lawyer once observed in his presence, "Coming through
the market just now I saw a butcher, with his knife, going to kill a
calf; at that moment a child ran across him, and he killed &mdash;&mdash;" "O, my
goodness!&mdash;he killed <i>the child</i>!" exclaimed his lordship. "No, my lord,
<i>the calf</i>; but you will always anticipate."</p>

<h4>DXII.&mdash;THE BEST JUDGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> said to her husband, in Jerrold's presence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear, you certainly want some new trousers."&mdash;"No, I think not,"
replied the husband.</p>

<p>"Well," Jerrold interposed, "I think the lady who always wears them
ought to know."</p>

<h4>DXIII.&mdash;THE RIVALS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A good</span> story of Gibbon is told in the last volume of Moore's Memoirs.
The <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> were Lady Elizabeth Foster, Gibbon the historian,
and an eminent French physician,&mdash;the historian and doctor being rivals
in courting the lady's favor. Impatient at Gibbon's occupying so much of
her attention by his conversation, the doctor said crossly to him,
"<i>Quand milady Elizabeth Foster sera malade de vos fadaises, je la
gu&eacute;rirai</i>." [When my Lady Elizabeth Foster is made ill by your twaddle,
I will cure her.] On which Gibbon, drawing himself up grandly, and
looking disdainfully at the physician, replied, "<i>Quand milady Elizabeth
Foster sera morte de vos recettes, je l'im-mor-taliserai</i>." [When my
Lady Elizabeth Foster is dead from your recipes I will immortalize her.]</p>

<h4>DXIV.&mdash;DEAD LANGUAGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many English who visited Paris in 1815 was Alderman Wood, who
had previously filled the office of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> Lord Mayor of London. He ordered a
hundred visiting cards, inscribing upon them. "Alderman Wood, <i>feu Lord
Maire de Londres</i>," which he distributed amongst people of rank, having
translated the word "late" into "<i>feu</i>," which we need hardly state
means "dead."</p>

<h4>DXV.&mdash;WALPOLIANA.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir John Germain</span> was so ignorant, that he is said to have left a legacy
to Sir Matthew Decker, as the <i>author</i> of St. Matthew's Gospel.</p>

<p>Churchill (General C&mdash;&mdash;, a natural son of the Marlborough family) asked
Pulteney the other day, "Well, Mr. Pulteney, will you break me,
too?"&mdash;"No, Charles," replied he, "<i>you break</i> fast enough of yourself!"
Don't you think it hurt him more than the other breaking would?</p>

<p>Walpole was plagued one morning with that oaf of unlicked antiquity,
Prideaux, and his great boy. He talked through all Italy, and everything
in all Italy. Upon mentioning Stosch, Walpole asked if he had seen his
collection. He replied, very few of his things, for he did not like his
company; that he never heard so much <i>heathenish talk</i> in his days.
Walpole inquired what it was, and found that Stosch had one day said
before him, <i>that the soul was only a little glue</i>.</p>

<h4>DXVI.&mdash;A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A clergyman</span>, who had to preach before Archbishop Whately, begged to be
let off, saying, "I hope your Grace will excuse my preaching next
Sunday."&mdash;"Certainly," said the other indulgently. Sunday came, and the
archbishop said to him, "Well! Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, what became of you? we expected
you to preach to-day."&mdash;"Oh, your Grace said you would excuse my
preaching to-day."&mdash;"Exactly; but I did not say I would excuse you
<i>from</i> preaching."</p>

<h4>DXVIII.&mdash;A NICE DISTINCTION.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> is the difference," asked Archbishop Whately of a young clergyman
he was examining, "between a form and a ceremony? The meaning seems
nearly the same; yet there is a very nice distinction." Various answers
were given. "Well," he said, "it lies in this: you sit upon a <i>form</i>,
but you stand upon <i>ceremony</i>."</p>

<h4>DXXI.&mdash;TIME WORKS WONDERS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> dining at a hotel, whose servants were "few and far
between," despatched a lad among them for a cut of beef. After a long
time the lad returned, and was asked by the faint and hungry gentleman,
"Are you the lad who took away my plate for this beef?"&mdash;"Yes,
sir."&mdash;"Bless me," resumed the hungry wit, "how <i>you have grown</i>!"</p>

<h4>DXXII.&mdash;A NOVEL IDEA.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Morrow's</span> Library" is the Mudie of Dublin; and the Rev. Mr. Day, a
popular preacher. "How inconsistent," said Archbishop Whately, "is the
piety of certain ladies here. They go to <i>Day</i> for a sermon and to
<i>Morrow</i> for a novel!"</p>

<h4>DXXIII.&mdash;THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> was described in a plea as "I. Jones," and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> pleader referred
in another part of the plea to "I" as an "initial." The plaintiff said
that the plea was bad, because "I" was not a name. Sir W. Maule said
that there was no reason why a man might not be christened "I" as well
as Isaac, inasmuch as either could be pronounced alone. The counsel for
the plaintiff then objected that the plea admitted that "I" was not a
name by describing it as "an initial."&mdash;"Yes," retorted the judge, "but
it does not aver that it is not a <i>final</i> as well as an <i>initial</i>
letter."</p>

<h4>DXXIV.&mdash;LOSING AN I.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> being interrogated on a trial, spoke several words with much
impropriety; and at last saying the word <i>curosity</i>, a counsellor
exclaimed, "How that fellow murders the English language!"&mdash;"Nay,"
returned another, "he has only knocked an <i>I</i> out."</p>

<h4>DXXV.&mdash;DRIVING IT HOME.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late James Fergusson, Clerk of Session, a most genial and amiable
man, of whose periodical fits of absence most edifying stories are still
repeated by his friends, was an excellent and eloquent speaker, but in
truth, there was often more sound than matter in his orations. He had a
habit of lending emphasis to his arguments by violently beating with his
clenched hand the bar before which he pleaded. Once when stating a case
to Lord Polkemmet, with great energy of action, his lordship interposed,
and exclaimed, "Maister Jemmy, dinna dunt; ye think ye're duntin't
<i>into</i> me, and ye're just duntin't <i>out o' me</i>."</p>

called him into the green-room, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> addressed him to this effect:
"Young man, you have not only pleased the public, but you have pleased
me; and, as a slight token of my regard and good wishes, I beg your
acceptance of a small <i>piece of plate</i>." It was, beyond all question, a
<i>very</i> small piece, for it was a silver toothpick!</p>

<h4>DXXVIII.&mdash;EPISCOPAL SAUCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a dinner-party Archbishop Whately called out suddenly to the host,
"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;!" There was silence. "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, what is the proper female
companion of this John Dory?" After the usual number of guesses an
answer came, "<i>Anne Chovy</i>."</p>

<h4>DXXIX.&mdash;A GOOD CRITIC.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A friend</span> of an artist was endeavoring to persuade him not to bestow so
much time upon his works. "You do not know, then," said he, "that I have
a master very difficult to please?"&mdash;"Who?"&mdash;"<i>Myself</i>."</p>

<h4>DXXX.&mdash;WILKES'S TERGIVERSATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Wilkes</span>, one day in his later life, went to Court, when George III. asked
him, in a good-natured tone of banter, how his friend Serjeant Glynn
was. Glynn had been one of his most furious partisans. Wilkes replied,
with affected gravity, "Nay, sire, don't call Serjeant Glynn a friend of
mine; the fellow was a <i>Wilkite</i>, which your Majesty knows <i>I never
was</i>."</p>

<h4>DXXXI.&mdash;A SLIGHT ERUPTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> came almost breathless to Lord Thurlow, and exclaimed, "My
lord, I bring tidings of calamity to the nation!"&mdash;"What has happened,
man?" said the astonished Chancellor. "My lord, a rebellion has broken
out."&mdash;"Where? where?"&mdash;"In the <i>Isle of Man</i>."&mdash;"In the Isle of Man,"

<h4>DXXXIII.&mdash;A TIMELY REPROOF.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> chaplain had preached a sermon of great length. "Sir," said Lord
Mulgrave, bowing to him, "there were some things in your sermon of
to-day I never heard before."&mdash;"O, my lord!" said the flattered
chaplain, "it is a common text, and I could not have hoped to have said
anything new on the subject."&mdash;"I heard the clock <i>strike twice</i>," said
Lord Mulgrave.</p>

<h4>DXXXV.&mdash;A SATISFACTORY REASON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alexander</span>, the architect of several fine buildings in the county of
Kent, was under cross-examination at Maidstone, by Serjeant (afterwards
Baron) Garrow, who wished to detract from the weight of his testimony.
"You are a builder, I believe?"&mdash;"No, sir: I am not a builder; I am an
architect!"&mdash;"Ah, well! architect or builder, builder or architect, they
are much the same, I suppose?"&mdash;"I beg your pardon, sir; I cannot admit
that: I consider them to be totally different!"&mdash;"O, indeed! perhaps you
will state wherein this great difference consists?"&mdash;"An architect, sir,
prepares the plans, conceives the design, draws out the
specifications,&mdash;in short, supplies the mind. The builder is merely the
bricklayer or the carpenter: the builder, in fact, is the machine,&mdash;the
architect the power that puts the machine together, and sets it
going!"&mdash;"O, very well, Mr. Architect, that will do! And now, after your
very ingenious distinction without a difference, perhaps you can inform
the court who was the architect for the Tower of Babel!"&mdash;"There was
<i>no</i> architect, sir, and hence <i>the confusion</i>!"</p>

signed <i>a round robin</i>, wherein they declared that they would not fire a
gun till they were paid. Captain Cornwallis, on receiving this
declaration, caused all hands to be called on deck, and thus addressed
them: "My lads, the money cannot be paid till we return to port, and as
to your not fighting, that is mere nonsense:&mdash;I'll clap you alongside
the first large ship of the enemy I see, and I know that the Devil

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. James Boswell</span>, the friend and biographer of Dr. Johnson, when a
youth, went to the pit of Covent Garden Theatre in company with Dr.
Blair, and, in a frolic, imitated the lowing of a cow; and the universal
cry in the galleries was, "Encore the cow! Encore the cow!" This was
complied with, and, in the pride of success, Mr. Boswell attempted to
imitate some other animals, but with less success. Dr. Blair, anxious
for the fame of his friend, addressed him thus: "My dear sir, I would
confine myself to <i>the cow</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord M&mdash;&mdash;</span> had a very exalted opinion of his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> cleverness, and once

thing, I always burst out a laughing!"&mdash;"I envy you your happiness, my

<i>merriest</i> life of any man in Europe."</p>

<h4>DLXV.&mdash;VULGAR ARGUMENTS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a club, of which Jerrold was a member, a fierce Jacobite, and a
friend, as fierce, of the cause of William the Third, were arguing
noisily, and disturbing less excitable conversationalists. At length the
Jacobite, a brawny Scot, brought his fist down heavily upon the table,
and roared at his adversary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is, sir, I spit upon your King William!"</p>

<p>The friend of the Prince of Orange was not to be out-mastered by mere
lungs. He rose, and roared back to the Jacobite:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I, sir, spit upon your James the Second!"</p>

<p>Jerrold, who had been listening to the uproar in silence, hereupon rung
the bell, and shouted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Waiter, <i>spittoons for two</i>!"</p>

<h4>DLXVI.&mdash;A CLEAR CASE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Justice Maule</span> would occasionally tax the powers of country juries.
<i>Ex. gr.</i> "Gentlemen," said the judge, "the learned counsel is perfectly
right in his law, there is <i>some</i> evidence upon that point; but he's a
lawyer, and you're not, and you don't know what he means by <i>some</i>
evidence, so I'll tell you. Suppose there was an action on a bill of
exchange, and six people swore they saw the defendant accept it, and six
others swore they heard him say he should have to pay it, and six others
knew him intimately, and swore to his handwriting; and suppose on the
other side they called a poor old man who had been at school with the
defendant forty years before and had not seen him since, and he said he
rather thought the acceptance was not his writing, why there'd be <i>some</i>
evidence that it was not, and that's what Mr. &mdash;&mdash; means in this case."
Need we add that the jury retired to consider their verdict?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<h4>DLXIX.&mdash;LAMB AND ERSKINE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Counsellor Lamb</span>, an old man when Lord Erskine was in the height of his
reputation, was of timid and nervous disposition, usually prefacing his
pleadings with an apology to that effect; and on one occasion, when
opposed, in some cause, to Erskine, he happened to remark that "he felt
himself growing more and more timid as he grew older."&mdash;"No wonder,"
replied the relentless barrister; "every one knows the older a <i>lamb</i>
grows, the more <i>sheepish</i> he becomes."</p>

<h4>DLXXII.&mdash;THEATRICAL WIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Hatton</span>, who was a considerable favorite at the Haymarket Theatre, and
particularly in the part of <i>Jack Junk</i>, was one night at Gosport,
performing the character of <i>Barbarossa</i>. In the scene where the tyrant
makes love to <i>Zapphira</i>, and reminds her of his services against the
enemies of her kingdom, he was at a loss, and could not catch the word
from the prompter, when, seeing the house crowded with sailors, and
regardless of the gross anachronism, he exclaimed, with all the energy
of tragedy&mdash;</p>

<h4>DLXXV.&mdash;THE HOPEFUL PUPIL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the comedy of "She Stoops to Conquer" was in rehearsal, Goldsmith
took great pains to give the performers his ideas of their several
parts. On the first representation he was not a little displeased to
hear the representative of <i>Young Marlow</i> play it as an Irishman. As
soon as <i>Marlow</i> came off the stage, Goldsmith asked him the meaning of
this, as it was by no means intended as an Irish character. "Sir,"
replied the comedian, "I spoke it as nearly as I could to the manner in
which you instructed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> me, except that I did not give it quite so strong

nobleman, "there may not be <i>one to fit</i> my shoulders."</p>

<h4>DLXXXII.&mdash;KEEPING A CONSCIENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great controversy on the propriety of requiring a subscription to

never pay you a farthing, you had better go home, mind your business,
and don't lose your time by calling here. As for the others, they are a

<i>did every bit</i> as well."</p>

<h4>DLXXXV.&mdash;SEEING A CORONATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A sad</span> mistake was once made at court by the beautiful and celebrated
Duchess of Hamilton. Shortly before the death of George II., and whilst
he was greatly indisposed, Miss Gunning, upon becoming Duchess of
Hamilton, was presented to his majesty. The king, who was particularly
pleased with the natural elegance and artlessness of her manner,
indulged in a long conversation with her grace. In the course of this
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> the duchess said, with great animation, "I have seen
everything! There is only one thing in this world I wish to see, and I
do long so much to see that!" The curiosity of the monarch was so
greatly excited to know what this wonderful thing could be, that he
eagerly asked her what it was. "A coronation," replied the thoughtless
duchess; nor was she at all conscious of the mistake she had made, till
the king took her hand with a sigh, and with a melancholy expression
replied, "I apprehend you have not long to wait; you will soon have
<i>your wish</i>." Her grace was overwhelmed with confusion.</p>

anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some merchants went to an Eastern sovereign, and exhibited for sale
several very fine horses. The king admired them, and bought them; he,

him. The king one day, in a sportive humor, ordered the vizier to make
out a list of all the fools in his dominions. He did so, and put his
Majesty's name at the head of them. The king asked why. He replied,
"Because you entrusted a lac of rupees to men you don't know, and who

<h4>DCXIII.&mdash;STRANGE JETSUM.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A thin</span> old man, with a rag-bag in his hand, was picking up a number of
small pieces of whalebone which lay on the street. The deposit was of
such a singular nature, that we asked the quaint-looking gatherer how he

voice; "but I 'spect some unfortunate female was <i>wrecked</i> hereabout
somewhere."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Why</span>, Mr. B.," said a tall youth to a little person who was in company
with half-a-dozen huge men, "I protest you are so very small I did not

<h4>DCXXX.&mdash;DODGING A CREDITOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A creditor</span>, whom he was anxious to avoid, met Sheridan coming out of
Pall Mall. There was no possibility of avoiding him, but he did not lose
his presence of mind. "That's a beautiful mare you are on!" said
Sheridan. "Do you think so?"&mdash;"Yes, indeed! how does she trot?" The
creditor, highly flattered, put her into full trot. Sheridan bolted
round the corner, and was <i>out of sight</i> in a moment.</p>

<h4>DCXXXI.&mdash;BAD HABIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Frederick Flood</span> had a droll habit, of which he could never
effectually break himself. Whenever a person at his back whispered or
suggested anything to him whilst he was speaking in public, without a
moment's reflection, he always repeated the suggestion <i>literatim</i>. Sir
Frederick was once making a long speech in the Irish Parliament, lauding
the transcendent merits of the Wexford magistracy, on a motion for
extending the criminal jurisdiction in that county, to keep down the
disaffected. As he was closing a most turgid oration by declaring "that
the said magistracy ought to receive some signal mark of the
Lord-Lieutenant's favor," John Egan, who was rather mellow, and sitting
behind him, jocularly whispered, "<i>and be whipped at the cart's
tail</i>."&mdash;"And be whipped at the cart's tail!" repeated Sir Frederick
unconsciously, amidst peals of uncontrollable laughter.</p>

<h4>DCXXXII.&mdash;WHO'S TO BLAME.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">King James</span> used to say, that he never knew a modest man make his way in
a court. As he was repeating this expression one day, a David Floyd, who
was then in waiting at his Majesty's elbow, replied bluntly, "Pray, sir,
whose <i>fault</i> is that!" The king stood corrected, and was silent.</p>

<h4>DCXXXIII.&mdash;THE LETTER H.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir James Scarlett</span>, when at the Bar, had to cross-examine a witness
whose evidence it was thought would be very damaging, unless he could be
bothered a little, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> his only vulnerable point was said to be his
self-esteem. The witness presented himself in the box,&mdash;a portly,
overdressed person,&mdash;and Scarlett took him in hand.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Mr. John Tomkins, I believe?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> You are a stock-broker?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I <i>ham</i>!</p>

<p>Scarlett regarded him attentively for a few moments, and then said: "And
a very fine, well-dressed <i>ham</i> you are, sir?"</p>

<p>The shouts of laughter which followed completely disconcerted the
witness, and the counsel's point was gained.</p>

<h4>DCXXXIV.&mdash;TRUTH AND RHYME.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the days of Charles II., candidates for holy orders were expected to
respond in Latin to the various interrogatories put to them by the
bishop or his examining chaplain. When the celebrated Dr. Isaac Barrow
(who was fellow of Trinity College, and tutor to the immortal Newton)
had taken his bachelor's degree, he presented himself before the
bishop's chaplain, who, with the stiff stern visage of the times, said
to Barrow,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Quid est fides</i>?" (What is faith?)</p>

<p>"<i>Quod non vides</i>" (What thou dost not see),</p>

<p>answered Barrow with the utmost promptitude. The chaplain, a little
vexed at Barrow's laconic answer, continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Quid est spes</i>?" (What is hope?)</p>

<p>"<i>Magna res</i>" (A great thing),</p>

<p>replied the young candidate in the same breath.</p>

<p>"<i>Quid est charitas</i>?" (What is charity?)</p>

<p>was the next question.</p>

<p>"<i>Magna raritas</i>" (A great rarity),</p>

<p>was again the prompt reply of Barrow, blending truth and rhyme with a
precision that staggered the reverend examiner, who went direct to the
bishop and told him that a young Cantab had thought proper to give
rhyming answers to three several moral questions, and added that he
believed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> his name was Barrow, of Trinity College, Cambridge. "Barrow,
Barrow!" said the bishop, who well knew the literary and moral worth of
the young Cantab, "if that's the case, ask him no more questions, for he
is much better qualified," continued his lordship, "to <i>examine us than
we him</i>." Barrow received his letters of orders forthwith.</p>

<h4>DCXXXIX.&mdash;ADVICE TO THE YOUNG.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerrold</span> said to an ardent young gentleman, who burned with a desire to

shutters before there is something in the window."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<h4>DCXL.&mdash;A PROMISE TO PAY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe Haines</span> was more remarkable for his practical jokes than for his
acting. He was seized one morning by two bailiffs, for a debt of 20l.,
as the Bishop of Ely was passing by in his coach. "Gentlemen," said Joe,
"here's my cousin the Bishop of Ely going by his house; let me but speak
to him, and he'll pay the debt and charges." The bailiffs thought they
might venture this, as they were within three or four yards of him. Joe
went boldly up to the coach, and pulled his hat off to the bishop. His
lordship ordered the coach to stop, when Joe whispered him gently, "My
lord, here are two men who have such great <i>scruples of conscience</i>,
that I fear they'll hang themselves."&mdash;"Very well," said the bishop; so,
calling to the bailiffs, he said, "You two men come to me to-morrow
morning, and <i>I will satisfy you</i>." The men bowed, and went away
pleased. Early on the following day, the bailiffs, expecting the debt
and charges, paid a visit to the bishop; when, being introduced, his
lordship addressed them. "Well, my men, what are your scruples of
conscience?"&mdash;"Scruples!" echoed the bailiff; "we have <i>no scruples</i>. We
are bailiffs, my lord, who yesterday arrested your cousin, Joe Haines,
for a debt of 20l.; and your lordship kindly promised to satisfy us
to-day." The bishop, reflecting that his honor and name would be exposed
were he not to comply, paid the debt and charges.</p>

<h4>DCXLI.&mdash;PUNCTUATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> gentlemen talking on the inattention of writers to punctuation, it
was observed that the lawyers used no stops in their writings. "I should
not mind that," said one of the party, "but they put no <i>periods</i> to
their works."</p>

<h4>DCXLII.&mdash;CON-CIDER-ATE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Bottetot</span>, in passing through Gloucester, soon after the cider tax,
in which he was very unpopular, observing himself burning in effigy, he
stopped his coach, and giving a purse of guineas to the mob, said,
"Pray, gentlemen, if you will burn me, burn me like a gentleman; do not
let me linger; I see you have <i>not faggots enough</i>." This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> good-humored
speech appeased the people, who gave him three cheers, and let him pass.</p>

<h4>DCXLIII.&mdash;FEAR OF EDUCATING WOMEN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a very general notion, that if you once suffer women to eat of
the tree of knowledge, the rest of the family will very soon be reduced
to the same kind of aerial and unsatisfactory diet.</p>

<h4>DCXLIV.&mdash;A-LIQUID.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Porson</span>, once conversing with a party of congenial friends, seemed at a
loss for <i>something</i> to cheer the inward man, and drawing his glass
mechanically towards him, he took up one bottle, and then another,
without finding wherewithal to replenish. A friend observing this, he
inquired what the professor was in search of. "Only <i>a-liquid</i>!"
answered Porson.</p>

<h4>DCXLV.&mdash;TOP AND BOTTOM.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following playful colloquy in verse took place at a dinner-table
between Sir George Rose and James Smith, in allusion to Craven Street,
Strand, where he resided:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>J.S.</i>&mdash;"At the top of the street ten attorneys find place,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ten dark coal barges are moored:<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Sir G.R.</i>&mdash;"Why should Honesty fly to some safer retreat,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">And the barges are <i>just</i> at the bottom."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>DCXLVI.&mdash;A SUGGESTIVE PRESENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerrold</span> and a company of literary friends were out in the country. In
the course of their walk, they stopped to notice the gambols of an ass's
foal. A very sentimental poet present vowed that he should like to send
the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> thing as a present to his mother. "Do," Jerrold replied,
"and tie a piece of paper round its neck, bearing this motto,&mdash;'When
this you see, remember me.'"</p>

<h4>DCXLVII.&mdash;A NEW DISGUISE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Duke of Norfolk of Foote's time was much addicted to the bottle. On
a masquerade night, he asked Foote what <i>new</i> character he should go in.
"Go sober!" said Foote.</p>

<h4>DCXLVIII.&mdash;WET AND DRY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Macknight</span>, who was a better commentator than preacher, having been
caught in a shower of rain, entered the vestry soaked with wet. As the
time drew on for divine service he became much distressed, and
ejaculated over and over, "O, I wish that I was dry! Do you think I'm
dry? Do you think I'm dry eneuch noo?" To this his jocose colleague, Dr.
Henry, the historian, returned: "Bide a wee, doctor, and ye'se be <i>dry
eneuch</i> when ye get into the <i>pu'pit</i>."</p>

<h4>DCXLIX.&mdash;RUM AND WATER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> Scotchman, who is not a member of any temperance society,
being asked by a dealer to purchase some fine old Jamaica, dryly
answered, "To tell you the truth, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, I canna' say I'm very fond
of rum; for if I tak' mair than <i>six</i> tum'lers, it's very apt to gi'e me
a headache."</p>

<h4>DCL.&mdash;A BUDGET OF BLUNDERS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the best concentrated specimen of blunders, such as occur in all
nations, but which, of course, are fathered upon Paddy wholesale, as if
by common consent, is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Copy of a Letter, written during the Rebellion by Sir &mdash;&mdash;, an Irish
Member of Parliament, to his friend in London.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>Having now a little peace and quietness, I sit down to inform you of the
dreadful bustle and confusion we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> in from these blood-thirsty
rebels, most of whom are, I'm glad to say, killed and dispersed. We are
in a pretty mess, can get nothing to eat, nor wine to drink, except
whiskey, and when we sit down to dinner we are obliged to keep both
hands armed. Whilst I write this, I hold a sword in each hand and a
pistol in the other. I concluded from the beginning that this would be
the end of it, and I see I was right, for it is not half over yet. At
present there are such goings on that everything is at a standstill. I
should have answered your letter a fortnight ago, but I did not receive
it till this morning. Indeed, scarcely a mail arrives safe without being
robbed. No longer ago than yesterday the coach with the mails from
Dublin was robbed near this town; the bags had been judiciously left
behind for fear of accident, and by good luck there was nobody in it but
two outside passengers, who had nothing for the thieves to take. Last
Thursday notice was given that a gang of rebels was advancing here under
the French standard, but they had no colors, nor any drums except
bagpipes. Immediately every man in the place, including women and
children, ran out to meet them. We soon found our force much too little;
we were far too near to think of retreating. Death was in every face,
but to it we went, and, by the time half our little party were killed,
we began to be all alive again. Fortunately the rebels had no guns,
except pistols, cutlasses, and pikes, and as we had plenty of muskets
and ammunition, we put them all to the sword. Not a soul of them
escaped, except some that were drowned in an adjacent bog, and, in a
very short time, nothing was to be heard but silence. Their uniforms
were all different colors, but mostly green. After the action we went to
rummage a sort of camp, which they had left behind them. All we found
was a few pikes, without heads, a parcel of empty bottles full of water,
and a bundle of French commissions filled up with Irish names. Troops
are now stationed all round the country, which exactly squares with my
ideas.</p>

<p>I have only time to add that I am in great haste.</p>

<p class="right">Yours truly,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;If you do not receive this, of course it must have miscarried,
therefore I beg you will write to let me know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<h4>DCLII.&mdash;WILKES AND A LIBERTY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> ungrateful was the sound of "Wilkes and No. 45" (the famous number of
the "North Briton") to George III., that about 1772, George IV., then a
mere boy, having been chid for some fault, and wishing to take his
boyish revenge, stole to the king's apartment, and shouting at the door,
"Wilkes and No. 45 for ever!" ran away.</p>

<h4>DCLIII.&mdash;A STRANGE OBJECTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> drinker being at table, they offered him grapes at dessert.

<h4>DCLIV.&mdash;THE TIMIDITY OF BEAUTY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It's</span> a great comfort for timid men, that beauty, like the elephant,
doesn't know its strength. Otherwise, how it would trample upon
us!&mdash;D.J.</p>

<h4>DCLV.&mdash;MAKING A CLEARANCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Glasgow forty years ago, when the time had come for the <i>bowl</i> to be
introduced, some jovial and thirsty member of the company proposed as a
toast, "The trade of Glasgow and <i>the outward bound</i>;" the hint was
taken, and silks and satins moved off to the drawing-room.</p>

<h4>DCLVI.&mdash;A SMART ONE-POUNDER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the "Beggar's Opera" was under rehearsal at the Haymarket Theatre,
in 1823, Miss Paton, who was to play the part of <i>Polly</i>, expressed a
wish to sing the air of "The Miser thus a Shilling sees," a note higher;
to which the stage-manager immediately replied, "Then, Miss, you must
sing, 'The Miser thus a <i>Guinea</i> sees.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<h4>DCLVII.&mdash;RESIGNATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> actor, on his benefit night, having a very limited audience, when he
came to the often-quoted passage, "'Tis not in mortals to command
success, We'll do more, Sempronius&mdash;we'll deserve it," heaved a deep
sigh, and substituted for the last line, "We'll do more,
Sempronius,&mdash;we'll do <i>without</i> it."</p>

<h4>DCLVIII.&mdash;DELPINI'S REMONSTRANCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Delpini</span> had repeatedly applied to the Prince of Wales to speak to the
Lord Chamberlain to grant him a license for a play at the Little Theatre
in the Haymarket, always pleading poverty: at last, when he once met his
Royal Highness coming out of Carlton House, he exclaimed, "Ah, votre
Altesse! mon Prince! If you do not speak to Milor Chamberlain for pauvre
Delpini, I must go to your <i>papa's</i> bench."</p>

<h4>DCLIX.&mdash;A PHONETIC JOKE.</h4>

<h4>DCLX.&mdash;PURE FOLKS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Very</span> pure folks won't be held up to the light and shown to be very dirty

<h4>DCLXII.&mdash;JUSTICE NOT ALWAYS BLIND.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Westmacott</span>, of the <i>Age</i> paper, having libelled a gentleman, was well

similar story is told of Voltaire and the Regent of France.</p>

<h4>DCLXIII.&mdash;KITCHENER AND COLMAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most celebrated wits and <i>bon vivants</i> of the day graced the
dinner-table of the late Dr. Kitchener, and, <i>inter alia</i>, the late
George Colman, who was an especial favorite; his interpolation of a
little monosyllable in a written admonition which the Doctor caused to
be placed on the mantlepiece of the dining parlor will never be
forgotten, and was the origin of such a drinking bout as was seldom
permitted under his roof. The caution ran thus: "Come at seven, go at
eleven." Colman briefly altered the sense of it; for, upon the Doctor's
attention being directed to the card, he read, to his astonishment,
"Come at seven, <i>go it</i> at eleven!" which the guests did, and the claret
was punished accordingly.</p>

<h4>DCLXIV.&mdash;A SPARE MAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerrold</span> said to a very thin man, "Sir, you are like a pin, but without
the head or the point."</p>

<h4>DCLXV.&mdash;A LONG BILL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Foote was at Salt Hill, he dined at the Castle Inn, and when
Partridge, the host, produced his bill, which was rather exorbitant, the
comedian asked him his name. "Partridge, sir," said he. "Partridge! It
should have been Woodcock, <i>by the length of your bill</i>!"</p>

<h4>DCLXVI.&mdash;ROYAL PUN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a noble Admiral of the White, well known for his gallant spirit,
his gentlemanly manners, and real goodness of heart, was introduced to
William the Fourth, to return thanks for his promotion, the cheerful and
affable monarch, looking at his hair, which was almost as white as the
newly-fallen snow, jocosely exclaimed, "White at <i>the main</i>, Admiral!
white at <i>the main</i>!"</p>

<h4>DCLXVII.&mdash;A COLORABLE RESEMBLANCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> silly brothers, twins, who were very much about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> town in Theodore
Hook's time, took pains, by dressing alike, to deceive their friends as
to their identity. Tom Hill (the original of Paul Pry) was expatiating
upon these modern Dromios, at which Hook grew impatient. "Well," said
Hill, "you will admit they resemble each other wonderfully: they are as
like as <i>two peas</i>."&mdash;"They are," retorted Hook, "and quite as <i>green</i>."</p>

<h4>DCLXVIII.&mdash;SPRANGER BARRY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> celebrated actor was, perhaps, in no part so excellent as that of
<i>Romeo</i>, for which he was particularly fitted by an uncommonly handsome
and commanding person, and a silver-toned voice. At the time that he
attracted the town to Covent Garden by his excellent performance of his
part, Garrick found it absolutely necessary to divide the attention of
the public by performing <i>Romeo</i> himself at Drury Lane. He wanted the
natural advantages of Barry, and, great as he was, would, perhaps, have
willingly avoided such a contention. This, at least, seems to have been
a prevailing opinion; for in the garden scene, when <i>Juliet</i> in
soliloquy exclaims, "<i>O Romeo, Romeo</i>, wherefore art thou <i>Romeo</i>?" an
auditor archly replied, aloud, "<i>Because Barry has gone to the other
house</i>."</p>

<h4>DCLXIX.&mdash;BAD SPORT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Hare</span>, formerly the envoy to Poland, had apartments in the same house
with Mr. Fox, and like his friend Charles, had frequent visits from
bailiffs. One morning, as he was looking out of his window, he observed
two of them at the door. "Pray, gentlemen," says he, "are you <i>Fox</i>
hunting, or <i>Hare</i> hunting this morning?"</p>

<h4>DCLXX.&mdash;MEASURE FOR MEASURE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> amiable Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash; always insists that her friends who take grog
shall mix <i>equal</i> quantities of spirits and water, though she never
observes the rule for herself. A writer of plays having once made a
glass under her directions, was asked by the lady, "Pray, sir, is it <i>As
you like it</i>?"&mdash;"No, madam," replied the dramatist; "it is <i>Measure for
Measure</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<h4>DCLXXI.&mdash;A PROBABILITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jonathan</span> and his friend Paddy were enjoying a delightful ride, when they
came in sight of what is very unusual in any civilized state
now-a-days&mdash;an old gallows or gibbet. This suggested to the American the
idea of being witty at the expense of his Irish companion. "You see
<i>that</i>, I calculate," said he nasally, pointing to the object just
mentioned; "and now where would <i>you</i> be if the gallows had its
due?"&mdash;"Riding <i>alone</i>," coolly replied Paddy.</p>

<h4>DCLXXII.&mdash;LEGAL ADULTERATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> publicans being assembled at Malton, in Yorkshire, in order to
renew their licenses to retail beer, the worthy magistrate addressed one
of them (an old woman), and said he trusted she did not put any
pernicious ingredients into the liquor; to which she immediately
replied: "I'll assure your worship there's naught pernicious put into
our barrels that I know of, but the <i>exciseman's stick</i>."</p>

<h4>DCLXXIV.&mdash;SALISBURY CATHEDRAL SPIRE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A sexton</span> in Salisbury Cathedral was telling Charles Lamb that eight
people had dined at the pointed top of the spire; upon which Lamb
remarked that they must have been very <i>sharp set</i>.</p>

<h4>DCLXXV.&mdash;AN ACT OF JUSTICE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Barton</span>, being in company with Dr. Nash, who had just printed two
heavy folios on the antiquities of Worcestershire, remarked that the
publication was deficient in several respects, adding, "Pray, doctor,
are you not a justice of the peace?"&mdash;"I am," replied Nash. "Then," said
Barton, "I advise you to send your work to the <i>house of correction</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<h4>DCLXXVII.&mdash;A VOLUMINOUS SPEAKER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A well-known</span> lawyer, Mr. Marryatt, who declared he had never opened any
book after he left school but a law book, once told a jury, when
speaking of a chimney on fire: "Gentlemen, the chimney took fire; it
poured forth <i>volumes</i> of smoke! <i>Volumes</i>, did I say? Whole

<h4>DCLXXVIII.&mdash;A SUGGESTIVE QUESTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas Jerrold</span>, discussing one day with Mr. Selby, the vexed question
of adapting dramatic pieces from the French, that gentleman insisted
upon claiming some of his characters as strictly original creations. "Do
you remember my Baroness in <i>Ask no Questions</i>?" said Mr. S. "Yes,
indeed. I don't think I ever saw a piece of yours without being struck
by your <i>barrenness</i>," was the retort.</p>

<h4>DCLXXIX.&mdash;LOVE AND HYMEN.</h4>

<h4>DCLXXX.&mdash;PAR NOBILE FRATRUM.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A former</span> laird of Brotherton was on all occasions a man of few words. He
had a favorite tame goose, and for hours together Brotherton and his
silent companion sat by the fireside opposite to each other. On one
occasion a candidate for the representation of the county in Parliament
called upon him to solicit his vote, and urged his request<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> with much
eloquence; to all which the laird replied only by nods and smiles,
without saying a word. When, however, the candidate was gone, he looked
across to his goose, and emphatically remarked, "I'm thinkin' yon windy
chiel'll no <i>tell muckle</i> that you and I <i>said</i> till him."</p>

<h4>DCLXXXI.&mdash;PLAIN LANGUAGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. John Clerk</span>, in pleading before the House of Lords one day, happened
to say, in his broadest Scotch accent, "In plain English, ma Lords;"
upon which Lord Eldon jocosely remarked, "In plain Scotch, you mean, Mr.
Clerk." The prompt advocate instantly rejoined, "Na matter! in plain
<i>common sense</i>, ma Lords, and that's the same in a' languages, ye'll
ken."</p>

<h4>DCLXXXII.&mdash;A SETTLER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A farmer</span>, in a stage-coach with Charles Lamb, kept boring him to death
with questions in the jargon of agriculturists about crops. At length he
put a poser&mdash;"And pray, sir, how are turnips t'year?"&mdash;"Why that, sir,"
stammered out Lamb, "will <i>depend</i> upon the boiled legs of mutton."</p>

<h4>DCLXXXIII.&mdash;CASH PAYMENTS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Peterson</span> the comedian lent a brother actor two shillings, and when he

<h4>DCLXXXV.&mdash;A REASONABLE DEMAND.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel B&mdash;&mdash;</span> was remarkably fat, and coming one night out of the

it, a friend, who was stepping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> into his chariot, called out to him,
"B&mdash;&mdash;, I go by your door, and will set you down." B&mdash;&mdash; gave the
chairman a shilling, and was going; when one of them scratched his head,
and hoped his honor would give him more than a shilling. "For what, you
scoundrel? when I never got into your chair?"&mdash;"But consider the fright
your honor put us into," replied Pat,&mdash;"<i>consider the fright</i>!"</p>

<h4>DCLXXXVI.&mdash;EBENEZER ADAMS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> celebrated Quaker, on visiting a lady of rank, whom he found six
months after the death of her husband, sitting on a sofa covered with
black cloth, and in all the dignity of woe, approached her with great
solemnity, and gently taking her by the hand, thus accosted her: "So
friend, I see that thou hast not yet <i>forgiven</i> God Almighty." This
seasonable reproof had such an effect upon the person to whom it was
addressed, that she immediately laid aside her trappings of grief, and
went about her necessary business and avocations.</p>

<h4>DCLXXXVII.&mdash;ONE BITE AT A CHERRY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> fellow once offered to kiss a Quakeress. "Friend," said she,

"Well, friend, as thee hast <i>sworn</i>, thee may do it, but thee must not
make a practice of it."</p>

<h4>DCLXXXVIII.&mdash;A FIG FOR THE GROCER!</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Abernethy was canvassing for the office of surgeon to St.
Bartholomew's Hospital, he called upon a rich grocer. The great man,
addressing him, said, "I suppose, sir, you want my vote and interest at
this momentous epoch of your life."&mdash;"No, I don't," said Abernethy. "I
want a pennyworth of figs; come, look sharp and wrap them up; I want to
be off!"</p>

<h4>DCLXXXIX.&mdash;STEAM-BOAT RACING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Charles Lyell</span>, when in the United States, received the following
advice from a friend: "When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> you are racing with an opposition
steam-boat, or chasing her, and the other passengers are cheering the
captain, who is sitting on the safety-valve to keep it down with his
weight, go as far as you can from the engine, and lose no time,
especially if you hear the captain exclaim, 'Fire up, boys! put on the
resin!' Should a servant call out, 'Those gentlemen who have not paid
their passage will please to go to the ladies' cabin,' obey the summons
without a moment's delay, for then an explosion may be apprehended. 'Why
to the ladies' cabin?' said I. Because it is the safe end of the boat,
and they are getting anxious for the personal security of those who have
not yet paid their dollars, being, of course, indifferent about the
rest. Therefore never pay in advance; for should you fall overboard
during a race, and the watch cries out to the captain, 'A passenger
overboard,' he will ask, 'Has he paid his passage?' and if he receives
an answer in the affirmative, he will call out '<i>Go ahead</i>!'"</p>

<h4>DCXC.&mdash;GENTLY, JEMMY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir James Mackintosh</span> invited Dr. Parr to take a drive in his gig. The
horse became restive. "Gently, Jemmy," says the doctor, "don't irritate
him; always soothe your horse, Jemmy. You'll do better without me. Let
me down, Jemmy." Once on <i>terra-firma</i>, the doctor's view of the case
was changed. "Now, Jemmy, touch him up. Never let a horse get the better
of you. Touch him up, conquer him, don't spare him; and now, I'll leave
you to manage him&mdash;<i>I'll walk back</i>."</p>

<h4>DCXCI.&mdash;WHAT'S IN A SYLLABLE?</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Longfellow</span>, the poet, was introduced to one Longworth, and some one
noticed the similarity of the first syllable of the names. "Yes," said
the poet, "but in this case I fear Pope's line will apply,&mdash;'<i>Worth</i>
makes the man, the want of it the <i>fellow</i>.'"</p>

<h4>DCXCII.&mdash;QUIET THEFT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A saddle</span> being missing at a funeral, it was observed, no wonder that
nothing was heard of it, for it is believed to have been stolen by a
<i>mute</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<h4>DCXCIII.&mdash;GOOD ADVICE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> man (placed by his friends as a student at a veterinary college)
being in company with some of his colleagues, was asked, "If a
broken-winded horse were brought to him for cure, what he would advise?"
After considering for a moment, "Advise," said he, "I should advise the
owner <i>to sell</i> as soon as possible."</p>

<h4>DCXCIV.&mdash;CRITICISING A STATUE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after Canning's statue was put up in Palace Yard, in all its
verdant freshness, the carbonate of copper not yet blackened by the
smoke of London, Mr. Justice Gazelee was walking away from Westminster
Hall with a friend, when the judge, looking at the statue (which is
colossal), said, "I don't think this is very like Canning; he was not so
<i>large</i> a man."&mdash;"No, my lord," replied his companion, "nor so <i>green</i>."</p>

<h4>DCXCV.&mdash;A COMPARISON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the assizes, in a case of assault and battery, where a stone had
been thrown by the defendant, the following clear and conclusive
evidence was drawn out of a Yorkshireman:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you see the defendant throw the stone?"&mdash;"I saw a stone, and I'ze
pretty sure the defendant throwed it."</p>

<p>"Was it a large stone?"&mdash;"I should say it wur a largish stone."</p>

<p>"What was its size?"&mdash;"I should say a sizeable stone."</p>

<p>"Can't you answer definitely how big it was?"&mdash;"I should say it wur a
stone of some bigness."</p>

<p>"Can't you give the jury some idea of the stone?"&mdash;"Why, as near as I
recollect, it wur something of a stone."</p>

<p>"Can't you compare it to some other object?"&mdash;"Why, if I wur to compare
it, so as to give some notion of the stone, I should say it wur as large
as a lump o' chalk!"</p>

<h4>DCXCVI.&mdash;FATIGUE DUTY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> reverend gentleman in the country was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> complaining to another
that it was a great fatigue to preach twice a day. "Oh!" said the other,
"I preach twice every Sunday, and <i>make nothing</i> of it."</p>

<h4>DCXCVII.&mdash;GLUTTONS AND EPICURES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Stephen Kemble</span> (who was very fat) and Mrs. Esten, were crossing the
Frith, when a gale sprang up, which alarmed the passengers. "Suppose,
Mr. Kemble," said Mrs. Esten; "suppose we become food for fishes, which
of us two do you think they will eat first?"&mdash;"Those that are

but the <i>epicures</i> will attack you!"</p>

<h4>DCXCVIII.&mdash;A BAD END.</h4>

<h4>DCC.&mdash;ACCOMMODATING PRINCIPLES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of Sir Robert Walpole's letters, he gives a very instructive
picture of a skilful minister and a condescending Parliament. "My dear
friend," writes Sir Robert, "there is scarcely a member whose purse I do
not know to a sixpence, and whose very soul almost I could not purchase
at the offer. The reason former ministers have been deceived in this
matter is evident&mdash;they never considered the temper of the people they
had to deal with. I have known a minister so weak as to offer an
avaricious old rascal a star and garter, and attempt to bribe a young
rogue, who set no value upon money, with a lucrative employment. I
pursue methods as opposite as the poles, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> therefore my
administration has been attended with a different effect."</p>

<p>"Patriots," says Walpole, "spring up like mushrooms. I could raise fifty
of them within four-and-twenty hours. I have raised many of them in one
night. It is but refusing to gratify an unreasonable or insolent demand,
and <i>up starts</i> a patriot."</p>

<h4>DCCI.&mdash;BOSWELL'S "LIFE OF JOHNSON."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Boswell's "Life of Johnson," first made its appearance, Boswell was
so full of it that he could neither think nor talk of anything else: so
much so, that meeting Lord Thurlow hurrying through Parliament Street to
get to the House of Lords, where an important debate was expected, and
for which he was already too late, Boswell had the temerity to stop and
accost him with "Have you read my book?"&mdash;"Yes, &mdash;&mdash; you!" replied Lord
Thurlow, "every word of it; I could not <i>help myself</i>."</p>

<h4>DCCII.&mdash;VERY LIKE A WHALE.</h4>

<h4>DCCIII.&mdash;A NEW SIGN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A drunken</span> fellow coming by a shop, asked an apprentice boy what the sign
was. He answered, that it was <i>a sign</i> he was drunk.</p>

<h4>DCCIV.&mdash;FALSE QUANTITIES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> man who, on a public occasion, makes a false quantity at the
outset of life, can seldom or never get over it.</p>

<h4>DCCV.&mdash;NOT TRUE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> was asked by her friends if she really intended to marry Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;, who was a good kind of a man, but so very singular. "Well,"
replied the lady, "if he is very much <i>unlike</i> other men, he is more
likely to make a good husband."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<h4>DCCVI.&mdash;BETTING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> folly of <i>betting</i> is well satirized in one of Walpole's Letters:
"Sept. 1st, 1750,&mdash;They have put in the papers a good story made at
White's. A man dropped down dead at the door, and was carried in; the
club immediately made bets whether he was dead or not, and when they
were going to bleed him the wagerers for his death interposed, and said
it would affect the fairness of the bet."</p>

<h4>DCCVII.&mdash;FIRE AND WATER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy</span> being asked if he thought of doing something, which, for his own
part, he deemed very unlikely, he said he should "as soon think of
attempting to light a cigar at <i>a pump</i>."</p>

<h4>DCCVIII.&mdash;THE RAILROAD ENGINEER.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>These lines will be read with a deep interest, as being literally the

author,&mdash;James Smith.</p>

<h4>DCCIX.&mdash;THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF FOLLY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Coleridge</span> once dined in company with a grave-looking person, an
admirable listener, who said nothing, but smiled and nodded, and thus
impressed the poet with an idea of his intelligence. "That man is a
philosopher," thought Coleridge. At length, towards the end of the
dinner, some apple-dumplings were placed on the table, and the listener
no sooner saw them than, almost jumping from his chair, he exclaimed,
"<i>Them's the jockeys for me</i>!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<h4>DCCX.&mdash;EQUALITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A highwayman</span> and a chimney-sweeper were condemned to be hanged the same
time at Tyburn,&mdash;the first for an exploit on the highway, the latter for
a more ignoble robbery. "Keep farther off, can't you?" said the
highwayman, with some disdain. "Sir," replied the sweep, "I <i>won't</i> keep
off; I have as much <i>right</i> to be here as you!"</p>

<h4>DCCXI.&mdash;A CANDID COUNSEL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> Irish counsel being asked by the judge for whom was he concerned,
replied, "I am <i>concerned</i> for the plaintiff, but I'm <i>retained</i> by the
defendant."</p>

<h4>DCCXII.&mdash;TRADE AGAINST LAND.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the late Mr. Whitbread's father, the brewer, first opposed the Duke
of Bedford's interest at Bedford, the Duke informed him that he would
spend &pound;50,000 rather than he should <i>come in</i>. Whitbread, with true
English spirit, replied, that was nothing; the sale of his grains would
pay for that.</p>

<h4>DCCXIII.&mdash;TRUE EVIDENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Jew</span> called on to justify bail in the Court of Common Pleas, the
opposing counsel thus examined him: "What is your
name?"&mdash;"Jacob."&mdash;"What are you?"&mdash;"General dealer."&mdash;"Do you keep a
shop?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"How then do you dispose of your goods?"&mdash;"To the <i>best
advantage</i>, my good fellow."</p>

<h4>DCCXIV.&mdash;DR. YOUNG.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Young</span> was walking in his garden at Welwyn, in company with two
ladies (one of whom he afterwards married), when the servant came to
acquaint him a gentleman wished to speak with him. As he refused to go,
one lady took him by the right arm, the other by the left, and led him
to the garden-gate; when, finding resistance in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> vain, he bowed, laid
his hand upon his heart, and spoke the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thus Adam looked, when from the garden driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus disputed orders sent from heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him I go, but yet to go am loth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him I go, for angels drove us both.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard was his fate, but mine is more unkind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Eve went with him, but mine stays behind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>DCCXV.&mdash;A YANKEE YARN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Dickens</span> tells an American story of a young lady, who, being
intensely loved by five young men, was advised to "jump overboard, and
marry the man who jumped in after her." Accordingly, next morning, the
five lovers being on deck, and looking very devotedly at the young lady,
she plunged into the sea head-foremost. Four of the lovers immediately
jumped in after her. When the young lady and four lovers were out again,
she says to the captain, "What am I to do with them now, they are so
wet?"&mdash;"Take the <i>dry one</i>." And the young lady did, and married him.</p>

<h4>DCCXVI.&mdash;SAVE US FROM OUR FRIENDS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old Scottish hearers were very particular on the subject of their
ministers' preaching old sermons; and to repeat a discourse which they
could recollect was always made a subject of animadversion by those who
heard it. A beadle who was a good deal of a wit in his way, gave a sly
hit in his pretended defence of his minister on the question. As they
were proceeding from church, the minister observed the beadle had been
laughing as if he had triumphed over some of his parishioners with whom
he had been in conversation. On asking the cause of this, he received
for answer, "Indeed, sir, they were saying ye had preached an auld

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old clergyman one Sunday, at the close of the sermon, gave notice to
the congregation that in the course of the week he expected to go on a
mission to the heathen. One of his parishioners, in great agitation,
exclaimed, "Why, my dear sir, you have never told us one word of this
before; what shall we do?"&mdash;"O, brother," said the parson, "I don't
expect to <i>go out</i> of this town."</p>

<h4>DCCLXXIX.&mdash;A POSER BY LORD ELLENBOROUGH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the Chief-Justiceship of the late Lord Ellenborough there was a
horse-cause, to which a certain Privy Councillor was a party, and who,
as of right, took his seat upon the bench at the hearing, and there
(while his adversary's counsel told his tale) ventured a whisper of
remark to the Chief Justice. "If you again <i>address me</i>, Sir W&mdash;&mdash;, I
shall give you in custody of the Marshal." It was a settler for him,
and, as it turned out, of his cause; for he lost it, and most justly
too.</p>

<h4>DCCLXXXI.&mdash;AN ARTISTIC TOUCH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Moore was getting his portrait painted by Newton, Sydney Smith, who
accompanied the poet, said to the artist, "Couldn't you contrive to
throw into his face somewhat of a stronger expression of <i>hostility</i> to
the Church Establishment?"</p>

<h4>DCCLXXXII.&mdash;VALUE OF APPLAUSE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> one remarked to Mrs. Siddons that applause was necessary to actors,
as it gave them confidence. "More," replied the actress; "it gives us
<i>breath</i>."</p>

<h4>DCCLXXXIII.&mdash;LITTLE TO GIVE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A stingy</span> husband threw off the blame of the rudeness of his children in
company, by saying that his wife always "Gives them their own
way."&mdash;"Poor things!" was the prompt response, "it's <i>all</i> I have to
<i>give them</i>."</p>

<h4>DCCLXXXIV.&mdash;A GOOD SWIMMER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A foolish</span> scholar having almost been drowned in his first attempt at

<p>[A similar story is told of a pedant by Hierocles.]</p>

<h4>DCCLXXXV.&mdash;NO PRIDE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A denizen</span> of the good city of St. Andrews, long desirous of being
elected deacon of his craft, after many years of scheming and bowing, at
last attained the acme of his ambition, and while the oaths of office
were being administered to him, a number of waggish friends waited
outside to "trot him out," but the sequel convinced them this was
unnecessary. On emerging from the City Hall, with thumbs stuck in the
armlets of his vest, with head erect, and solemn step, he approached his
friends, lifting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> up his voice and saying, "Now, billies, <i>supposing</i>
I'm a deacon, mind, I can be <i>spoken</i> to at ony time."</p>

<h4>DCCLXXXVI.&mdash;LORD CLONMEL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Lord Clonmel, who never thought of demanding more than a
shilling for an affidavit, used to be well satisfied, provided it was a
<i>good one</i>. In his time the Birmingham shillings were current, and he
used the following extraordinary precautions to avoid being imposed upon
by taking a bad one: "You shall true answer make to such questions as
shall be demanded of you touching this affidavit, so help you, &amp;c. <i>Is
this a good shilling?</i> Are the contents of this affidavit true? Is this
your name and handwriting?"</p>

<h4>DCCLXXXVII.&mdash;QUEER PARTNERS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerrold</span>, at a party, noticed a doctor in solemn black waltzing with a
young lady who was dressed in a silk of brilliant blue. "As I live!
there's a blue pill dancing with a black draught!" said Jerrold.</p>

<h4>DCCLXXXVIII.&mdash;CORRUPTLY INCORRUPTIBLE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles the Second</span> once said to Sidney, "Look me out a man that can't be
corrupted: I have sent three treasurers to the North, and they have all
turned thieves."&mdash;"Well, sire, I will recommend Mivert."&mdash;"Mivert!"
exclaimed the king, "why, Mivert is a thief already."&mdash;"Therefore <i>he
cannot be corrupted</i>, your majesty," answered Sidney.</p>

<h4>DCCLXXXIX.&mdash;EPIGRAM ON THE MARRIAGE OF A VERY THIN COUPLE.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h4>DCCXC.&mdash;GOOD AUTHORITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Horne Tooke</span>, during his contest for Westminster, was thus addressed by a

Tooke, you will have all the <i>blackguards</i> with you to-day."&mdash;"I am
delighted to hear it, sir, and from such <i>good</i> authority."</p>

<h4>DCCXCI.&mdash;LUXURIOUS SMOKING.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> most luxurious smoker I ever knew," says Mr. Paget, "was a young
Transylvanian, who told me that his servant always inserted a lighted
pipe into his mouth the first thing in the morning, and that he smoked
it out before he awoke. 'It is so pleasant,' he observed, 'to have the
proper <i>taste</i> restored to one's mouth before one is sensible even of
its wants.'"</p>

<h4>DCCXCII.&mdash;NO JUDGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> Judge having somewhat hastily delivered judgment in a
particular case, a King's Counsel observed, in a tone loud enough to
reach the bench, "Good heavens! every judgment of this court is a mere
<i>toss-up</i>." "But <i>heads</i> seldom win," observed a learned barrister,
sitting behind him.</p>

<h4>DCCXCIII.&mdash;RELATIONS OF MANKIND.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> what curious links, and fantastical relations, are mankind connected
together! At the distance of half the globe, a Hindoo gains his support
by groping at the bottom of the sea for the morbid concretion of a
shell-fish, to decorate the throat of a London alderman's wife.&mdash;S.S.</p>

<h4>DCCXCIV.&mdash;VERY TRUE.</h4>

<h4>DCCXCVI.&mdash;DRINKING ALONE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> author of the "Parson's Daughter," when surprised one evening in his
arm-chair, two or three hours after dinner, is reported to have
apologized, by saying, "When one is alone, the bottle <i>does</i> come round
<i>so</i> often." On a similar occasion, Sir Hercules Langreish, on being
asked, "Have you finished all that port (three bottles) without
assistance?" answered, "No&mdash;not quite that&mdash;I had the <i>assistance</i> of a
bottle of Madeira."</p>

<h4>DCCXCVII.&mdash;A MUSICAL BLOW-UP.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Rev. Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, when residing at Canterbury some years ago, was
reckoned a good violoncello-player. His sight being dim obliged him very
often to snuff the candles, and in lieu of snuffers he generally
employed his fingers in that office, thrusting the <i>spoils</i> into the
<i>sound-holes</i> of his violoncello. A waggish friend of his popped a
quantity of gunpowder into B&mdash;&mdash;'s instrument. The tea equipage being
removed, music became the order of the evening, and B&mdash;&mdash; dashed away at
Vanhall's 47th. B&mdash;&mdash; came to a bar's rest, the candles were snuffed,
and he thrust the ignited wick into the usual place&mdash;<i>fit fragor</i>, and
bang went the fiddle to pieces.</p>

<h4>DCCXCVIII.&mdash;READY-MADE WOOD PAVEMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Marylebone vestrymen were discussing the propriety of laying
down wood pavement within their parish, and were raising difficulties on
the subject, Jerrold, as he read the report of the discussion, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Difficulties in the way! Absurd. They have only to put their heads
together, and there is the wood pavement."</p>

<p>This joke has been erroneously given to Sydney Smith.</p>

<h4>DCCXCIX.&mdash;PROPER DISTINCTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> undergraduate had unconsciously strayed into the garden of a certain
D.D., then master of the college adjoining.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> He had not been there many
minutes, when Dr. &mdash;&mdash; entered himself, and, perceiving the student, in
no very courteous manner desired the young gentleman to walk out; which
the undergraduate not doing (in the opinion of the doctor) in sufficient
haste, Domine demanded, rather peremptorily, "whether he knew who he
was?" at the same time informing the intruder he was Dr. &mdash;&mdash;. "That,"
replied the undergraduate, "is impossible; for Dr. &mdash;&mdash; is a
<i>gentleman</i>, and you are a <i>blackguard</i>!"</p>

<h4>DCCC.&mdash;GRACEFUL EXCUSE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">William IV.</span> seemed in a momentary dilemma one day, when, at table with
several officers, he ordered one of the waiters to "take away that
marine there," pointing to an empty bottle. "Your majesty!" inquired a
colonel of marines, "do you compare an empty bottle to a member of our
branch of the service?"&mdash;"Yes," replied the monarch, as if a sudden
thought had struck him; "I mean to say it has <i>done its duty</i> once, and
is ready to do it again."</p>

<h4>DCCCI.&mdash;SLACK PAYMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Examining</span> a country squire who disputed a collier's bill, Curran asked,
"Did he not give you the coals, friend?"&mdash;"He did, sir, but&mdash;"&mdash;"But
what? On your oath, witness, wasn't your payment <i>slack</i>?"</p>

<h4>DCCCII.&mdash;WAY OF USING BOOKS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterne</span> used to say, "The most accomplished way of using books is to
serve them as some people do lords, learn their <i>titles</i> and then <i>brag</i>
of their acquaintance."</p>

<h4>DCCCIII.&mdash;PATRICK HENRY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Patrick Henry, who gave the first impulse to the ball of the
American Revolution, introduced his celebrated resolution on the Stamp
Act into the House of Burgesses of Virginia (May, 1765), he exclaimed,
when descanting on the tyranny of the obnoxious Act, "C&aelig;sar had his
Brutus; Charles I. his Cromwell; and George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> III...."&mdash;"Treason!" cried
the speaker; "treason, treason!" echoed from every part of the house. It
was one of those trying moments which are decisive of character. Henry
faltered not for an instant; but rising to a loftier attitude, and
fixing on the speaker an eye flashing with fire, continued, "<i>may profit
by their example</i>. If this be treason, make the most of it."</p>

<h4>DCCCIV.&mdash;ROGERS&mdash;POET AND SKIPPER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Rogers</span> used to say that a man who attempts to read all the new
publications must often do as the flea does&mdash;<i>skip</i>.</p>

<h4>DCCCV.&mdash;OUR ENGLISH LOVE OF DINNERS.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">If</span> an earthquake were to engulf England to-morrow," said Jerrold, "the
English would manage to meet and dine somewhere among the rubbish, just
to celebrate the event."</p>

<h4>DCCCVI.&mdash;EPIGRAM.</h4>

<h4>DCCCVII.&mdash;REFORMATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Burnet</span>, son of the famous Bishop of Salisbury, when young, is said
to have been of a wild and dissipated turn. Being one day found by the
Bishop in a very serious humor, "What is the matter with you, Tom?" said
he, "what are you ruminating on?"&mdash;"A greater work than your lordship's
History of the Reformation," answered the son. "Ay! what is that?" said
the Bishop. "The <i>reformation of myself</i>, my lord," answered the son.</p>

<h4>DCCCVIII.&mdash;THE JEST OF ANCESTRY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chesterfield</span> placed among the portraits of his ancestors two old
heads, inscribed Adam de Stanhope,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> and Eve de Stanhope: the ridicule is
admirable.</p>

<p>Old Peter Leneve, the herald, who thought ridicule consisted in not
being of an old family, made this epitaph for young Craggs, whose father
had been a footman: <i>Here lies the last who died before the first of his
family!</i> Old Craggs was one day getting into a coach with Arthur Moore,
who had worn a livery too, when he turned about, and said, "Why, Arthur,
I am always going to get up behind; are not you?"</p>

<p>The Gordons trace their name no farther back than the days of Alexander
the Great, from Gordonia, a city of Macedon, which, they say, once
formed part of Alexander's dominions, and, from thence, no doubt, the
clan must have come!</p>

<h4>DCCCIX.&mdash;EQUAL TO NOTHING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> being informed that the judges in the Court of Common Pleas had
little or nothing to do, Bushe remarked, "Well, well, they're <i>equal to
it</i>!"</p>

<h4>DCCCX.&mdash;FAMILIARITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A waiter</span> named Samuel Spring having occasion to write to his late
Majesty, George IV., when Prince of Wales, commenced his letter as
follows: "Sam, the waiter at the Cocoa-Tree, presents his compliments to
the Prince of Wales," &amp;c. His Royal Highness next day saw Sam, and after
noticing the receiving of his note, and the freedom of the style, said,
"Sam, this may be very well between <i>you and me</i>, but it will not do
with the Norfolks and Arundels."</p>

<h4>DCCCXI.&mdash;EXTRAORDINARY COMPROMISE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Durham assize a deaf old lady, who had brought an action for damages
against a neighbor, was being examined, when the judge suggested a
compromise, and instructed counsel to ask what she would take to settle
the matter. "His lordship wants to know what you will take?" asked the
learned counsel, bawling as loud as ever he could in the old lady's ear.
"I thank his lordship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> kindly," answered the ancient dame; "and if it's
no ill-convenience to him, I'll take a little <i>warm ale</i>!"</p>

<h4>DCCCXII.&mdash;MAC READY TO CALL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the time of Sir John Macpherson's Indian government, most of his
staff consisted of Scotch gentlemen, whose names began with Mac. One of
the aides-de-camp used to call the government-house <i>Almack's</i>, "For,"
said he, "if you stand in the middle of the court, and call <i>Mac</i>, you
will have a head popped out of every window."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom Moore</span>, observing himself to be eyed by two handsome young ladies,
inquired of a friend, who was near enough to hear their remarks, what it
was they said of him. "Why, the taller one observed that she was
delighted to have had the pleasure of seeing so famous a
personage."&mdash;"Indeed!" said the gratified poet, "anything more?"&mdash;"Yes:
she said she was the more pleased because she had taken in <i>your</i>

<h4>DCCCXVII.&mdash;BRIEF CORRESPONDENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Foote</span>, mother of Aristophanes, experienced the caprice of fortune
nearly as much as her son. The following laconic letters passed between
them: "Dear Sam, I am in prison."&mdash;Answer: "Dear mother, so am I."</p>

<h4>DCCCXVIII.&mdash;MAN-TRAPS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> being unlawful to set man-traps and spring-guns, a gentleman once hit
upon a happy device. He was a scholar, and being often asked the meaning
of mysterious words compounded from the Greek, that appear in every
day's newspaper, and finding they always excited wonder by their length
and sound, he had painted on a board, and put up on his premises, in
very large letters, the following: "<i>Tondapamubomenos set up in these
grounds</i>." It was perfectly a "patent safety."</p>

<h4>DCCCXIX.&mdash;A COLORABLE EXCUSE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> who painted her face, asked Parsons how he thought she looked. "I

<h4>DCCCXXI.&mdash;A WONDERFUL CURE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Hill</span>, a notorious wit, physician, and man of letters, having
quarrelled with the members of the Royal Society, who had refused to
admit him as an associate, resolved to avenge himself. At the time that
Bishop Berkeley had issued his work on the marvellous virtues of
tar-water, Hill addressed to their secretary a letter purporting to be
from a country-surgeon, and reciting the particulars of a cure which he
had effected. "A sailor," he wrote, "<i>broke</i> his leg, and applied to me
for help. I bound together the broken portions, and washed them with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the celebrated <i>tar-water</i>. Almost immediately the sailor felt the
beneficial effects of this remedy, and it was not long before his leg
was completely <i>healed</i>!" The letter was read, and discussed at the
meetings of the Royal Society, and caused considerable difference of
opinion. Papers were written for and against the tar-water and the
restored leg, when a second letter arrived from the (pretended) country
practitioner:&mdash;"In my last I omitted to mention that the broken limb of
the sailor was a <i>wooden leg</i>!"</p>

<h4>DCCCXXII.&mdash;AN ACCOMMODATING PHYSICIAN.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Is</span> there anything the matter with you?" said a physician to a person
who had sent for him. "O dear, yes, I am ill all over, but I don't know
what it is, and I have no particular pain nowhere," was the reply. "Very
well," said the doctor, "I'll give you something to <i>take away all
that</i>."</p>

<h4>DCCCXXIII.&mdash;CHOICE SPIRITS.</h4>

Potter. "True," replied the poet; "Potter's field <i>to bury</i> strangers

<h4>DCCCXXV.&mdash;IMPROMPTU BY R.B. SHERIDAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Erskine</span> having once asserted, in the presence of Lady Erskine and

<h4>DCCCXXXIII.&mdash;A BAD LOT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> household furniture of an English barrister, then recently deceased,

<h4>DCCCXXXVII.&mdash;A SINECURE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> Patrick Maguire had been appointed to a situation the reverse of a
place of all work; and his friends, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> called to congratulate him,
were very much astonished to see his face lengthened on the receipt of
the news. "A sinecure is it?" exclaimed Pat. "Sure I know what a
<i>sinecure</i> is: it's a place where there's <i>nothing to do</i>, and they <i>pay
you by the piece</i>."</p>

<h4>DCCCXXXVIII.&mdash;A GOOD JAIL DELIVERY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Brother David Dewar</span> was a plain, honest, straightforward man, who never
hesitated to express his convictions, however unpalatable they might be
to others. Being elected a member of the Prison Board, he was called
upon to give his vote in the choice of a chaplain from the licentiates
of the Established Kirk. The party who had gained the confidence of the
Board had proved rather an indifferent preacher in a charge to which he
had previously been appointed; and on David being asked to signify his
assent to the choice of the Board, he said, "Weel, I've no objections to
the man, for I understand he preached <i>a kirk toom</i> (empty) already, and
if he be as successful <i>in the jail</i>, he'll maybe preach it vawcant as
weel."</p>

<h4>DCCCXXXIX.&mdash;WHERE IS THE AUDIENCE?</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> manager of a country theatre looked into the house between the acts,
and turned with a face of dismay to the prompter, with the question of,
"Why, good gracious, where's the audience?"&mdash;"Sir," replied the
prompter, without moving a muscle, "he is just now gone to get some
beer." The manager wiped the perspiration from his brow and said, "Will
he <i>return</i> do you think?"&mdash;"Most certainly; he expresses himself highly
satisfied with the play, and applauded as one man."&mdash;"<i>Then let business
proceed</i>," exclaimed the manager, proudly; and it did proceed.</p>

<h4>DCCCXL.&mdash;KNOWING BEST.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I wish</span>, reverend father," said Curran to Father O'Leary, "that you were
St. Peter, and had the keys of heaven, because then you could let me
in."&mdash;"By my honor and conscience," replied O'Leary, "it would be better
for you that I had the keys of the <i>other</i> place, for then I could let
<i>you out</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<h4>DCCCXLI.&mdash;AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Bishop Blomfield, when a Suffolk clergyman, asked a school-boy
what was meant in the Catechism by <i>succoring</i> his father and mother.
"<i>Giving on 'em milk</i>," was the prompt reply.</p>

<h4>DCCCXLII.&mdash;PARLIAMENTARY REPRIMAND.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the reign of George II., Mr. Crowle, a counsel of some eminence, was
summoned to the bar of the House of Commons to receive a reprimand from
the Speaker, on his knees. As he rose from the ground, with the utmost
<i>nonchalance</i> he took out his handkerchief, and, wiping his knees, cooly
observed, "that it was the <i>dirtiest</i> house he had ever been in in his
life."</p>

<h4>DCCCXLIII.&mdash;A STOP WATCH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> missing his watch in a crowd at the theatre, observed, with
great coolness, that he should certainly recover it, having bought it of
a friend who had <i>introduced it to the particular acquaintance of every
Pawnbroker within the Bills of Mortality</i>.</p>

<h4>DCCCXLIV.&mdash;SIR ANTHONY MALONE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Mansfield</span> used to remark that a lawyer could do nothing without his
fee. This is proved by the following fact: Sir Anthony Malone, some
years ago Attorney-General of Ireland, was a man of abilities in his
profession, and so well skilled in the practice of conveyancing that no
person ever entertained the least doubt of the validity of a title that
had undergone his inspection; on which account he was generally applied
to by men of property in transactions of this nature. It is, however, no
less singular than true, that such was the carelessness and inattention
of this great lawyer in matters of this sort that related to himself,
that he made two bad bargains, for want only of the same attentive
examination of the writings for which he was celebrated, in one of which
he lost property to the amount of three thousand pounds a year.
Disturbed by these losses, whenever for the future he had a mind to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
purchase an estate for himself, he gave the original writings to his
principal clerk, who made a correct transcript of them; this transcript
was then handed to Sir Anthony, and five guineas (his fee) along with
it, which was regularly <i>charged to him by the clerk</i>. Sir Anthony then
went over the deeds with his accustomed accuracy and discernment, and
never after that was possessed of a bad title.</p>

voice, was going to act Cardinal Wolsey,</p>

<p><i>Jerrold.</i>&mdash;"Cardinal Wolsey!&mdash;Linsey Wolsey!"</p>

<h4>DCCCXLVII.&mdash;FEW FRIENDS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A nobleman</span>, extremely rich but a miser, stopping to change horses at
Athlone, the carriage was surrounded by paupers, imploring alms, to whom
he turned a deaf ear, and drew up the glass. A ragged old woman, going
round to the other side of the carriage, bawled out, in the old peer's
hearing, "Please you, my lord, just chuck <i>one</i> tin-penny out of your
coach, and I'll answer it will trait <i>all your friends</i> in Athlone."</p>

<h4>DCCCXLVIII.&mdash;DIFFIDENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> Irishman charged with an assault, was asked by the judge whether he

but one man, who being asked why he did not weep with the rest, said, "O
no, I belong to <i>another</i> parish."</p>

<h4>DCCCLI.&mdash;HIGHLAND POLITENESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Walter Scott</span> had marked in his diary a territorial greeting of two
proprietors which had amused him much. The laird of Kilspindie had met
the laird of Tannachy-Tulloch, and the following compliments passed
between them: "Ye're maist obedient hummil servant, Tannachy-Tulloch."
To which the reply was, "Your nain man, Kilspindie."</p>

<h4>DCCCLII.&mdash;AN ODD QUESTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Counselor Rudd</span>, of the Irish bar, was equally remarkable for his love of
whist, and the dingy color of his linen. "My dear Dick," said Curran to
him one day, "you can't think how puzzled we are to know where <i>you buy</i>
all your <i>dirty</i> shirts."</p>

<h4>DCCCLIII.&mdash;NOT INSURED AGAINST FIRE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Foote</span> went to spend his Christmas with Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, when, the weather
being very cold, and but bad fires, occasioned by a scarcity of wood in
the house, Foote, on the third day after he went there, ordered his
chaise, and was preparing to depart. Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; pressed him to stay. "No,
no," says Foote; "was I to stay any longer, you would not let me <i>have a
leg to stand on</i>; for there is so <i>little wood</i> in your house, that I am
afraid one of your servants may light the fire with <i>my right leg</i>,"
which was his wooden one.</p>

<h4>DCCCLIV.&mdash;NATURAL GRIEF.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> hiring a lodging said to the landlady, "I assure you, madam, I am so
much liked that I never left a lodging but my landlady shed
tears."&mdash;"Perhaps," said she, "you always went away without <i>paying</i>."</p>

<h4>DCCCLVI.&mdash;A CLOSE ESCAPE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of James Smith's favorite anecdotes related to Colonel Greville. The
Colonel requested young James to call at his lodgings, and in the course
of their first interview related the particulars of the most curious
circumstance in his life. He was taken prisoner during the American war,
along with three other officers of the same rank: one evening they were
summoned into the presence of Washington, who announced to them that the
conduct of their Government, in condemning one of his officers to death,
as a rebel, compelled him to make reprisals; and that, much to his
regret, he was under the necessity of requiring them to cast lots,
without delay, to decide which of them should be hanged. They were then
bowed out, and returned to their quarters. Four slips of paper were put
into a hat, and the shortest was drawn by Captain Asgill, who exclaimed,
"I knew how it would be; I never won so much as a hit at backgammon in
my life." As Greville was selected to sit up with Captain Asgill, "And
what," inquired Smith, "did you say to comfort him?"&mdash;"Why, I remember
saying to him, when they left us, '<i>D&mdash;&mdash; it, old fellow, never mind</i>!'"
But it may be doubted (added Smith) whether he drew much comfort from
the exhortation. Lady Asgill persuaded the French Minister to interpose,
and the Captain was permitted to escape.</p>

<h4>DCCCLVII.&mdash;A HARD HIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Major B&mdash;&mdash;</span>, a great gambler, said to Foote, "Since I last saw you, I
have <i>lost</i> an eye."&mdash;"I am sorry for it," said Foote, "pray <i>at what
game</i>?"</p>

<h4>DCCCLVIII.&mdash;THE TIME OUT OF JOINT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> one who had been down in Lord Kenyon's kitchen, remarked that he
saw the spit shining as bright as if it had never been used. "Why do you
mention his spit?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> said Jekyll; "you must know that nothing <i>turns upon
that</i>." In reference to the same noble lord, Jekyll observed, "It was
Lent all the year round in the kitchen, and <i>Passion</i> week in the
parlor."</p>

<h4>DCCCLIX.&mdash;MONEY'S WORTH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A soldier</span>, having retired from service, thought to raise a few pounds by
writing his adventures. Having completed the manuscript, he offered it
to a bookseller for forty pounds. It was a very small volume, and the
bookseller was much surprised at his demand. "My good sir," replied the
author, "as a soldier I have always resolved to <i>sell my life as dearly
as possible</i>."</p>

<h4>DCCCLX.&mdash;HIS WAY&mdash;OUT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Richard Jebb</span>, the famous physician, who was very rough and harsh in

<h4>DCCCLXII.&mdash;A MODERN SCULPTOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> and Smith were met by an overdressed individual, "Do you know that
chap, Smith?" said Brown. "Yes, I know him; that is, I know of
him,&mdash;he's a sculptor."&mdash;"Such a fellow as that a <i>sculptor</i>! surely you
must be mistaken."&mdash;"He may not be the kind of one you mean, but I know
that he <i>chiselled</i> a tailor&mdash;out of a suit of clothes last week."</p>

<h4>DCCCLXIII.&mdash;A DIFFICULT TASK.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">You</span> have only yourself to please," said a married<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> friend to an old
bachelor. "True," replied he, "but you cannot tell what a <i>difficult</i>
task I find it."</p>

<h4>DCCCLXIV.&mdash;THE GOUTY SHOE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">James Smith</span> used to tell, with great glee, a story showing the general
conviction of his dislike to ruralities. He was sitting in the library
at a country-house, when a gentleman proposed a quiet stroll in the
pleasure-grounds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stroll! why, don't you see my gouty shoe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see that plain enough, and I wish I'd brought one too; but they
are all out now."</p>

<p>"Well, and what then?"</p>

<p>"What then? why, my dear fellow, you don't mean to say that you have
really got the gout? I thought you had only put on that shoe to get off
being shown over the improvements."</p>

<h4>DCCCLXV.&mdash;A LUSUS NATUR&AElig;.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> agricultural society offered premiums to farmers' daughters, "girls
under twenty-one years of age," who should exhibit the best lots of
butter, not less than 10 lbs. "That is all right," said an old maid,
"save the insinuation that some girls are <i>over</i> twenty-one years of
age."</p>

<h4>DCCCLXVI.&mdash;A CASE OF NECESSITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A shopkeeper</span>, who had stuck up a notice in glaring capitals, "Selling
off! Must close on Saturday!" was asked by a friend, "What! are you
selling off?"&mdash;"Yes, all the shopkeepers are selling off, ain't
they?"&mdash;"But you say, 'Must close on Saturday.'"&mdash;"To be sure; would you
have me <i>keep open</i> on Sunday!"</p>

<h4>DCCCLXVII.&mdash;SPECIES AND SPECIE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> preaching a charity sermon, Sydney Smith frequently repeated the
assertion that, of all nations, Englishmen were most distinguished for
their generosity, and the love of their <i>species</i>. The collection
happened to be inferior to his expectation, and he said that he had
evidently made a great mistake; for that his expression should have
been, that they were distinguished for the love of their <i>specie</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<h4>DCCCLXVIII.&mdash;DR. JOHNSON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Dr. Johnson courted Mrs. Potter, whom he afterwards married, he
told her that he was of mean extraction; that he had no money; and that
he had had an uncle hanged! The lady, by way of reducing herself to an
equality with the Doctor, replied, that she had no more money than
himself; and that, though she had not had a relation hanged, she had
fifty who <i>deserved hanging</i>.</p>

<h4>DCCCLXX.&mdash;A COMEDIAN AND A LAWYER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> years ago, when Billy Burton, the American actor, was in his
"trouble," a young lawyer was examining him as to how he had spent his
money. There was about three thousand pounds unaccounted for, when the
attorney put on a severe scrutinizing face, and exclaimed, with much
self-complacency,&mdash;"Now, sir, I want you to tell this court and jury how
you used those three thousand pounds." Burton put on one of his
serio-comic faces, winked at the audience, and exclaimed, "<i>The lawyers
got that</i>!" The judge and audience were convulsed with laughter. The
counsellor was glad to let the comedian go.</p>

<h4>DCCCLXXI.&mdash;VICE VERSA.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is asserted that the bad Ministers have contracted the National Debt.
This cannot be; for instead of <i>contracting</i> it at all, bad Ministers

<h4>DCCCLXXII.&mdash;NOTHING PERSONAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a dinner-party one day a certain knight, whose character was
considered to be not altogether unexceptionable, said he would give them

celebrated for wit than beauty, gave "Honest men an' bonny
lasses!"&mdash;"With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> all my heart, Sir John," said Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;, "for it

<h4>DCCCLXXIV.&mdash;A MISTAKE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Dick Baldwin stoutly maintained that no man ever died of drinking.
"Some puny things," he said, "have died of <i>learning</i> to drink, but no
man ever died of drinking." Mr. Baldwin was no mean authority; for he
spoke from great practical experience, and was, moreover, many years
treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>

<h4>DCCCLXXV.&mdash;AN IMPOSSIBLE RENUNCIATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Dr. Risk, of Dalserf, being one of the moderators, did not
satisfy, by his preaching, the Calvinistic portion of his flock. "Why,
sir," said they, "we think you dinna tell us enough about renouncing our
ain righteousness."&mdash;"Renouncing your ain righteousness!" vociferated
the astonished doctor, "I never <i>saw any ye had to renounce</i>!"</p>

<h4>DCCCLXXVI.&mdash;THE HUMANE SOCIETY AT AN EVENING PARTY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> an evening party, a very elderly lady was dancing with a young

<p>"One of the Humane Society, I should think," replied Jerrold.</p>

<h4>DCCCLXXVII.&mdash;A PROUD HEART.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mathews</span>, whose powers in conversation and whose flow of anecdote in
private life transcended even his public efforts, told a variety of

implements of his trade, exclaiming, "Jan, what's the mother done with

"Confound her proud heart!" rejoins the collier, "why could she not take
th' <i>ould</i> ones?"</p>

<h4>DCCCLXXVIII.&mdash;SENT HOME FREE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> considerate hotel-keeper, advertising his "Burton XXXX,"

<h4>DCCCLXXIX.&mdash;CHARLES II. AND MILTON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles II.</span> and his brother James went to see Milton, to reproach him,

Providence," replied the venerable bard, "has punished my sins with

Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, he one day met a couple
of undergraduates, who neglected to pay the accustomed compliment of
<i>capping</i>. The bishop inquired the reason of the neglect. The two men
begged his lordship's pardon, observing they were <i>freshmen</i>, and did
not know him. "How long have you been in Cambridge?" asked his lordship.
"Only <i>eight</i> days," was the reply. "Very good," said the bishop,
"<i>puppies</i> never see till they are <i>nine</i> days old."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

success. Your pieces have all been tried before."</p>

<h4>DCCCLXXXIV.&mdash;BETTER KNOWN THAN TRUSTED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A well-known</span> borrower stopped a gentleman whom he did not know, and

<h4>DCCCLXXXV.&mdash;WILL AND THE WAY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a provincial Law Society's dinner the president called upon the

<h4>DCCCLXXXVI.&mdash;A REASONABLE EXCUSE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> lamented the difficulty he found in persuading his friends to

<h4>DCCCLXXXVII.&mdash;BEWICK, THE ENGRAVER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Duke of Northumberland first called to see Mr. Bewick's
workshops at Newcastle, he was not personally known to the engraver. On
discovering the high rank of his visitor, Bewick exclaimed, "I beg
pardon, my lord, I did not know your grace, and was unaware I had the
honor of talking to so great a man." To which the Duke good humoredly
replied, "You are a much greater man than I am, Mr. Bewick." To this
Bewick answered, "No, my lord: but were <i>I</i> Duke of Northumberland,
perhaps I could be."</p>

<h4>DCCCLXXXVIII.&mdash;SUMMARY DECISION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brougham</span>, when at the bar, opened before Lord Chief Justice
Tenterden an action for the amount of a wager laid upon the event of a

that the dogs should fight."&mdash;"Then I," replied the Judge, "<i>am minded</i>
to hear no more of it:" and he called another cause.</p>

<h4>DCCCLXXXIX.&mdash;A DISAPPOINTING SUBSCRIBER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> all letters soliciting "subscriptions," Lord Erskine had a regular

<h4>DCCCXC.&mdash;HABEAS CORPUS ACT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Burnet</span> relates a curious circumstance respecting the origin of
that important statute, the Habeas Corpus Act. "It was carried," says
he, "by an odd artifice in the House of Lords. Lord Grey and Lord Norris
were named to be the tellers. Lord Norris was not at all times attentive
to what he was doing; so a very fat lord coming in, Lord Grey counted
him for ten, as a jest at first; but seeing Lord Norris had not observed
it, he went on with this misreckoning of <i>ten</i>; so it was reported to
the House,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> and declared that they who were for the bill were the
majority, and by this means the bill passed."</p>

<h4>DCCCXCV.&mdash;CHARITABLE WIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Wit</span> in an influential form was displayed by the Quaker gentleman
soliciting subscription for a distressed widow, for whom everybody
expressed the greatest sympathy. "Well," said he, "everybody declares he
is sorry for her; I am truly sorry&mdash;I am sorry five pounds. How much art
thou sorry, friend? and thou? and thou?" He was very successful, as may
be supposed. One of those to whom the case was described said he <i>felt</i>
very much, indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> for the poor widow. "But hast thou felt in thy
pocket?" inquired the "Friend."</p>

<h4>DCCCXCVI.&mdash;USE IS SECOND NATURE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A tailor</span> that was ever accustomed to steal some of the cloth his
customer brought, when he came one day to make himself a suit, stole
half-a-yard. His wife perceiving it, asked the reason; "Oh," said he,
"it is to <i>keep</i> my hands in use, lest at any time I should <i>forget
it</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Irish girl told her forbidden lover she was longing to possess his
portrait, and intended to obtain it. "But how if your friends see it?"
inquired he. "Ah, but I'll tell the artist <i>not</i> to make it <i>like you</i>,
so they won't know it."</p>

<h4>CM.&mdash;THE REBEL LORDS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the trial of the rebel lords, George Selwyn, seeing Bethel's sharp
visage looking wistfully at the prisoners, said, "What a shame it is to
turn her face to the prisoners, until they are condemned!"</p>

<p>Some women were scolding Selwyn for going to see the execution, and
asked him how he could be such a barbarian to see the head cut off?
"Nay," replied he, "if that was such a crime, I am sure I have made
amends; for I went to see it sewed on again."</p>

<p>Walpole relates: "You know Selwyn never thinks but <i>&agrave; la t&ecirc;te
tranch&eacute;e</i>." On having a tooth drawn, he told the man that he would drop
his handkerchief for the signal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<h4>CMI.&mdash;A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> are you this morning?" said Fawcett to Cooke.</p>

<p>"Not at all myself," says the tragedian. "Then I congratulate you,"
replied Fawcett; "for, be whoever <i>else</i> you will, <i>you</i> will be a
gainer by the bargain."</p>

<h4>CMII.&mdash;THE DIRECT ROAD.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Walking</span> to his club one evening with a friend, some intoxicated young
gentleman reeled up to Douglas Jerrold, and said: "Can you tell us the
way to the 'Judge and Jury?'" (a place of low entertainment). "<i>Keep on
as you are</i>, young gentleman," was the reply, "you're sure to <i>overtake
them</i>."</p>

<h4>CMIII.&mdash;A SUGGESTIVE PAIR OF GRAYS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerrold</span> was enjoying a drive one day with a well-known,&mdash;a jovial
spendthrift.</p>

<p>"Well, Jerrold," said the driver of a very fine pair of grays, "what do
you think of my grays?"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," Jerrold replied, "I was just thinking of your
duns!"</p>

<h4>CMIV.&mdash;DR. JOHNSON'S OPINION OF MRS. SIDDONS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Dr. Johnson visited Mrs. Siddons, he paid her two or three very
elegant compliments. When she retired, he said to Dr. Glover, "Sir, she
is a prodigiously fine woman."&mdash;"Yes," replied Dr. Glover; "but don't
you think she is much finer upon the stage, when she is adorned by
art?"&mdash;"Sir," said Dr. Johnson, "on the stage <i>art</i> does not adorn her:
<i>nature adorns</i> her there, and <i>art glorifies</i> her."</p>

<h4>CMV.&mdash;A GOOD NEIGHBOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Duke of L.'s reply, when it was observed to him, that the gentlemen
bordering on his estates were continually hunting upon them, and that he
ought not to suffer it, is worthy of imitation: "I had much rather,"
said he, "have <i>friends</i> than hares."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<h4>CMVI.&mdash;AN EQUIVOCATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A diminutive</span> attorney, named Else, once asked Jekyll: "Sir, I hear you
have called me a pettifogging scoundrel. Have you done so, sir?"&mdash;"No,
sir," said Jekyll, with a look of contempt. "I never said you were a
pettifogger, or a scoundrel; but I did say you were <i>little Else</i>."</p>

<h4>CMVII.&mdash;A WISE FOOL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> wishing to test whether a daft individual, about whom a variety
of opinions were entertained,&mdash;some people thinking him not so foolish
as he seemed,&mdash;knew the value of money, held out a sixpence and a penny,
and offered him his choice. "I'll tak' the <i>wee</i> ane," he says, giving
as his modest reason, "I'se no' be greedy." At another time, a miller,
laughing at him for his witlessness, he said, "Some things I ken, and
some I dinna ken." On being asked what he knew, he said, "I ken a miller
has <i>aye a gey fat sou</i>."&mdash;"An' what d'ye no ken?" said the miller.
"Ou," he returned, "I dinna ken at wha's <i>expense</i> she's fed."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> gentlemen standing together, as a young lady passed by them, one
said, "There goes the handsomest woman you ever saw." She turned back,
and, seeing him very ugly, said, "I wish I could, in return, say as much
of you."&mdash;"So you may, madam," said he, "and <i>lie</i> as I <i>did</i>."</p>

<h4>CMX.&mdash;A MAN WITHOUT A RIVAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">General Lee</span> one day found Dr. Cutting, the army surgeon, who was a
handsome and dressy man, arranging his cravat complacently before a
glass. "Cutting," said Lee, "you must be the happiest man in
creation."&mdash;"Why, general?"&mdash;"Because," replied Lee, "you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> are in love

<h4>CMXII.&mdash;GARRICK AND FOOTE.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> Lying Valet" being one hot night annexed as an afterpiece to the
comedy of "The Devil upon Two Sticks," Garrick, coming into the Green
Room, with exultation called out to Foote, "Well, Sam, I see, after all,
you are glad to take up with one of <i>my</i> farces."&mdash;"Why, yes, David,"
rejoined the wit; "what could I do better? I must have some ventilator
for this hot weather."</p>

<h4>CMXIII.&mdash;NOTHING TO LAUGH AT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lord Lauderdale intimated his intentions to repeat some good thing
Sheridan had mentioned to him, "Pray, don't, my dear Lauderdale," said
the wit; "a joke in <i>your</i> mouth is no laughing matter!"</p>

<h4>CMXIV.&mdash;QUITE AGROUND.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is said that poor H&mdash;&mdash; T&mdash;&mdash; has been living on his wits. He
certainly must be content with very <i>limited premises</i>.</p>

<h4>CMXV.&mdash;A JUDGE IN A FOG.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the judges of the King's Bench, in an argument on the
construction of a will, sagely declared, "It appeared to him that the
testator meant to keep a <i>life-interest</i> in the estate to
himself."&mdash;"Very true, my lord," said Curran gravely; "but in this case
I rather think your lordship <i>takes the will for the deed</i>."</p>

<h4>CMXVI.&mdash;THE LETTER H.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a dispute, whether the letter H was really a letter or a simple
aspiration, Rowland Hill contended that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> the former; adding that,
if it were not a letter, it must have been a very serious affair to him,
by making him <i>ill</i> (<i>Hill</i> without <i>H</i>) all the days of his life.</p>

<h4>CMXVII.&mdash;ONLY ENOUGH FOR ONE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheridan</span> was once staying at the house of an elderly maiden lady in the
country, who wanted more of his company than he was willing to give.
Proposing one day to take a stroll with him, he excused himself on
account of the badness of the weather. Shortly afterwards she met him
sneaking out alone. "So, Mr. Sheridan," said she, "it has cleared
up."&mdash;"Just a <i>little</i>, ma'am&mdash;enough for one, but not enough for two."</p>

<h4>CMXVIII.&mdash;"THE RULING PASSION STRONG IN DEATH."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Curran's</span> ruling passion was his joke. In his last illness, his physician
observing in the morning that he seemed to cough with more difficulty,
he answered, "That is rather surprising, as I have been <i>practising</i> all
night."</p>

<h4>CMXX.&mdash;CUP AND SAUCER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span>, who was remarkable at once for Bacchanalian devotion and
remarkably large and starting eyes, was one evening the subject of
conversation. The question appeared to be, whether the gentleman in
question wore upon his face any signs of his excesses. "I think so,"
said Jerrold; "I always know when he has been in his cups by the state
of his saucers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<h4>CMXXI.&mdash;A NEW READING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Kemble</span> playing <i>Hamlet</i> in the country, the gentleman who acted

<i>Hamlet</i> asks him, "Will you play upon this pipe?"&mdash;"My lord, I
cannot."&mdash;"I pray you."&mdash;"Believe me, I cannot."&mdash;"I do beseech
you."&mdash;"Well, if your lordship insists on it, I shall do as well as I
can"; and to the confusion of <i>Hamlet</i>, and the great amusement of the
audience, he played "God save the king!"</p>

<h4>CMXXII.&mdash;CONCEITED, BUT NOT SEATED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> ex-members are announced as about <i>to stand</i> at the ensuing

for there are very few who can reasonably expect to <i>sit</i>.&mdash;G. A'B.</p>

<h4>CMXXIII.&mdash;STRANGE VESPERS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> who had a brother, a priest, was asked, "Has your brother a

<h4>CMXXIV.&mdash;A TRANSFORMATION SCENE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir B&mdash;&mdash; R&mdash;&mdash;</span>, in one of the debates on the question of the Union,

<h4>CMXXVI.&mdash;ACCURATE DESCRIPTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> lawyer received a severe injury from something in the shape of

<i>racecourse</i>."</p>

<h4>CMXXVII.&mdash;SOLOMON'S TEMPLE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Reginald Heber read his prize poem of "Palestine" to Sir Walter
Scott, the latter observed that, in the verses on Solomon's Temple, one
striking circumstance had escaped him; namely, that no tools were used
in its erection. Reginald retired for a few minutes to the corner of the
room, and returned with the beautiful lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No hammer fell, no ponderous axes rung;<br /></span>

<h4>CMXXVIII.&mdash;THE STAFFORDSHIRE COLLIERIES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> anecdotes might be collected to show the great difficulty of
discovering a person in the collieries without being in possession of
his nickname. The following was received from a respectable attorney.
During his clerkship he was sent to serve some legal process on a man
whose name and address were given to him with legacy accuracy. He
traversed the village to which he had been directed from end to end
without success; and after spending many hours in the search was about
to abandon it in despair, when a young woman who had witnessed his
labors kindly undertook to make inquiries for him, and began to hail her
friends for that purpose. "Oi say, Bullyed, does thee know a man named
Adam Green?" The bull-head was shaken in sign of ignorance. "Loy-a-bed,
does thee?" Lie-a-bed's opportunities of making acquaintance had been
rather limited, and she could not resolve the difficulty. Stumpy (a man
with a wooden leg), Cowskin, Spindleshanks, Corkeye, Pigtail, and
Yellowbelly were severally invoked, but in vain; and the querist fell
into a <i>brown study</i>, in which she remained for some time. At length,
however, her eyes suddenly brightened, and, slapping one of her
companions on the shoulder, she exclaimed, triumphantly, "Dash my wig!
whoy he means my feyther!" and then, turning to the gentleman, she
added, "You should ha' ax'd for <i>Ould Blackbird</i>!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<h4>CMXXIX.&mdash;A POSER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Foote</span> was once met by a friend in town with a young man who was flashing
away very brilliantly, while Foote seemed grave: "Why, Foote," said his
friend, "you are flat to-day; you don't seem to relish a joke!"&mdash;"You
have not <i>tried me</i> yet, sir," said Foote.</p>

<h4>CMXXX.&mdash;MINDING HIS CUE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Elliston</span> was enacting the part of <i>Richmond</i>; and having, during the
evening, disobeyed the injunction which the King of Denmark lays down to
the Queen, "Gertrude, do not drink," he accosted Mr. Powell, who was
personating <i>Lord Stanley</i> (for the safety of whose son <i>Richmond</i> is
naturally anxious), <span class="smcap">thus</span>, on his entry, after the issue of the battle:&mdash;</p>

<p>Elliston (as <i>Richmond</i>). Your son, George Stanley, is he dead?</p>

<p>Powell (as <i>Lord Stanley</i>). He is, my Lord, and <i>safe in Leicester
town</i>!</p>

<p>Elliston (as <i>Richmond</i>). I mean&mdash;ah!&mdash;is he missing?</p>

<p>Powell (as <i>Lord Stanley</i>). He is, my Lord, and <i>safe in Leicester
town</i>!!</p>

<p>And it is but justice to the memory of this punctilious veteran, to say
that he would have made the same reply to any question which could, at
that particular moment, have been put to him.</p>

<h4>CMXXXII.&mdash;LATE AND EARLY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> regular routine of clerkly business ill suited the literary tastes
and the wayward habits of Charles Lamb. Once, at the India House, a
superior said to him, "I have remarked, Mr. Lamb, that you come very
<i>late</i> to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> office."&mdash;"Yes, sir," replied the wit, "but you must
remember that I go away <i>early</i>." The oddness of the excuse silenced the
reprover.</p>

<h4>CMXXXIII.&mdash;FAIR PLAY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Curran</span>, who was a very small man, having a dispute with a brother
counsel (who was a very stout man), in which words ran high on both
sides, called him out. The other, however, objected. "You are so
little," said he, "that I might fire at you a dozen times without
hitting, whereas, the chance is that you may shoot me at the first
fire."&mdash;"To convince you," cried Curran, "I don't wish to take any
advantage, you shall <i>chalk</i> my size upon <i>your body</i>, and all hits out
of the ring shall go for nothing."</p>

<h4>CMXXXIV.&mdash;SOMETHING LACKING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Hook</span> was walking one day with a friend, when the latter, pointing out on
a dead wall an incomplete inscription, running, "<span class="smcap">Warren's B&mdash;&mdash;</span>," was
puzzled at the moment for the want of the context. "'Tis <i>lacking</i> that
should follow," observed Hook, in explanation.</p>

<h4>CMXXXVI.&mdash;THREE DEGREES OF COMPARISON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span>, proud of her rank and title, once compared the three classes of
people, nobility, gentry, and commonalty, to china, delf, and crockery.
A few minutes elapsed, when one of the company expressed a wish to see
the lady's little girl, who, it was mentioned, was in the nursery.
"John," said she to the footman, "tell the maid to bring the little
dear." The footman, wishing to expose his mistress's ridiculous pride,
cried, loud enough to be heard by every one,&mdash;"<i>Crockery</i>! bring down
little <i>China</i>."</p>

<h4>CMXXXVIII.&mdash;ELEGANT RETORT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a common occurrence in the University of Cambridge for the
undergraduates to express their approbation or disapprobation of the
Vice-Chancellor, on the resignation of his office. Upon an occasion of
this kind, a certain gentleman had enacted some regulations which had
given great offence; and, when the senate had assembled in order that he
might resign his office to another, a great <i>hissing</i> was raised in
disapprobation of his conduct; upon which, bowing courteously, he made
the following elegant retort:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h4>CMXL.&mdash;A PROPER ANSWER.</h4>

<h4>CMXLII.&mdash;AN UNCONSCIOUS POSTSCRIPT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">George Selwyn</span> once affirmed, in company, that no woman ever wrote a
letter without a postscript. "My next letter shall refute you!" said
Lady G&mdash;&mdash;. Selwyn soon after received a letter from her ladyship,
where, after her signature, stood: "P.S. Who was right; you or I?"</p>

<h4>CMXLIII.&mdash;HOAXING AN AUDIENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Cooke</span> was announced one evening to play the <i>Stranger</i> at the Dublin
Theatre. When he made his appearance, evident marks of agitation were
visible in his countenance and gestures: this, by the generality of the
audience, was called fine acting; but those who were acquainted with his
failing, classed it very properly under the head of intoxication. When
the applause had ceased, with difficulty he pronounced, "Yonder
hut&mdash;yonder hut," pointing to the cottage; then beating his breast, and
striking his forehead, he paced the stage in much apparent agitation of
mind. Still this was taken as the <i>chef-d'&#339;uvre</i> of fine acting, and
was followed by loud plaudits, and "Bravo! bravo!" At length, having
cast many a menacing look at the prompter, who repeatedly, though in
vain, gave him the word, he came forward, and, with overacted feeling,
thus addressed the audience: "You are a mercantile people&mdash;you know the
value of money&mdash;a thousand pounds, my all, lent to serve a friend, is
lost for ever. My son, too&mdash;pardon the feelings of a parent&mdash;my only
son&mdash;as brave a youth as ever fought his country's battles, is slain&mdash;not
many hours ago I received the intelligence; but he died in the
defence of his King!" Here his feelings became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> so powerful that they
choked his utterance, and, with his handkerchief to his eyes, he
staggered off the stage, amidst the applause of those who, not knowing
the man, pitied his situation. Now, the fact is, Cooke never possessed
&pound;1,000 in his life, nor had he ever the honor of being a father; but,
too much intoxicated to recollect his part, he invented this story, as
the only way by which he could decently retire; and the sequel of the
business was, that he was sent home in a chair, whilst another actor
played the part.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Come</span> here, Johnny, and tell me what the four <i>seasons</i> are." Young

<h4>CMXLV.&mdash;NOT AT HOME.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A weaver</span>, after enjoying his potations, pursued his way home through the
churchyard, his vision and walking somewhat impaired. As he proceeded,
he diverged from the path, and unexpectedly stumbled into a partially
made grave. Stunned for a while, he lay in wonder at his descent, and
after some time he got out, but he had not proceeded much further when a
similar calamity befell him. At this second fall, he was heard, in a
tone of wonder and surprise, to utter the following exclamation,
referring to what he considered the untenanted graves, "Ay! ir ye <i>a' up
an' awa</i>?"</p>

<h4>CMXLVI.&mdash;LINCOLN'S-INN DINNERS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the evening of the coronation-day of our gracious Queen, the Benchers
of Lincoln's Inn gave the students a feed; when a certain profane wag,
in giving out a verse of the National Anthem, which he was solicited to
lead in a solo, took that opportunity of stating a grievance as to the

him on the head, said, "You have played very well, sir, very well. It's
a pity,&mdash;but there's <i>too little</i> of you to do anything."</p>

<p>Coleridge said of this "little" actor: "Kean is original; but he copies
from himself. His rapid descent from the hyper-tragic to the
infra-colloquial, though sometimes productive of great effect, are often
unreasonable. To see him act, is like reading 'Shakespeare' by flashes

the corpse to the family vault at Chiswick, and there very sincerely
paid a plentiful tribute of tears to his memory. On his return to town,
Harry Woodward asked him if he had not been paying the last compliment
to his friend Holland? "Yes, poor fellow," says Foote, almost weeping at

<h4>MXVI.&mdash;A TRANSPORTING SUBJECT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject for the Chancellor's English Prize Poem, for the year 1823,

<p><span class="smcap">A member</span> of one of the dramatic funds was complaining of being obliged
to retire from the stage with an income of only one hundred and fifty

<h4>MXXV.&mdash;DOING HOMAGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Returning</span> from hunting one day, George III. entered affably into
conversation with his wine-merchant, Mr. Carbonel, and rode with him
side by side a considerable way. Lord Walsingham was in attendance; and
watching an opportunity, took Mr. Carbonel aside, and whispered
something to him. "What's that? what's that Walsingham has been saying
to you?" inquired the good-humored monarch. "I find, sir, I have been
unintentionally guilty of disrespect; my lord informed me that I ought
to have taken off my hat whenever I addressed your Majesty; but your
Majesty will please to observe, that whenever I hunt, my hat is fastened
to my wig, and my wig is fastened to my head, and I am on the back of a
very high-spirited horse, so that if anything <i>goes off</i> we must <i>all go
off together</i>!" The king laughed heartily at this apology.</p>

<h4>MXXVIII.&mdash;GOOD AT A PINCH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A severe</span> snow-storm in the Highlands, which lasted for several weeks,
having stopped all communication betwixt neighboring hamlets,
snuff-takers were reduced to their last pinch. Borrowing and begging
from all the neighbors within reach were resorted to, but this soon
failed, and all were alike reduced to the extremity which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> unwillingly
abstinent snuffers alone know. The minister of the parish was amongst
the unhappy number; the craving was so intense, that study was out of
the question. As a last resort, the beadle was despatched through the
snow, to a neighboring glen in the hope of getting a supply; but became
back as unsuccessful as he went. "What's to be dune, John?" was the
minister's pathetic inquiry. John shook his head, as much as to say that
he could not tell; but immediately thereafter started up, as if a new
idea had occurred to him. He came back in a few minutes, crying, "Hae."
The minister, too eager to be scrutinizing, took a long, deep pinch, and
then said, "Whaur did you get it?"&mdash;"<i>I soupit<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> the poupit</i>," was
John's expressive reply. The minister's accumulated superfluous Sabbath

<h4>MXXX.&mdash;WILKES'S READY REPLY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Luttrel</span> and Wilkes were standing on the Brentford hustings, when Wilkes
asked his adversary, privately, whether he thought there were more fools
or rogues among the multitude of Wilkites spread out before them. "I'll
tell them what you say, and put an end to you," said the Colonel. But,
perceiving the threat gave Wilkes no alarm, he added, "Surely you don't
mean to say you could stand here one hour after I did so?"&mdash;"Why (the
answer was), you would not be alive one instant after."&mdash;"How so?"&mdash;"I
should merely say it was a <i>fabrication</i>, and they would <i>destroy you</i>
in the twinkling of an eye!"</p>

<h4>MXXXI.&mdash;TOO GRATEFUL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> O'Connell had obtained the acquittal of a horse-stealer, the

</div></div>

<h4>MXXXIII.&mdash;ODD HOUSEKEEPING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Montgomery</span> was the only&mdash;the motherless&mdash;daughter of the stern
General Campbell, who early installed her into the duties of
housekeeper, and it sometimes happened that, in setting down the
articles purchased, and their prices, she put the "cart before the
horse." Her gruff papa never lectured her verbally, but wrote his
remarks on the margin of the paper, and returned it for correction. One
such instance was as follows: "General Campbell thinks
five-and-six-pence exceedingly dear for parsley." Henrietta instantly
saw her mistake; but, instead of formally rectifying it, wrote against
the next item,&mdash;"Miss Campbell thinks <i>twopence-halfpenny</i> excessively
<i>cheap for fowls</i>"; and sent it back to her father.</p>

<h4>MXXXIV.&mdash;TELLING ONE'S AGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span>, complaining how rapidly time stole away, said: "Alas! I am near
thirty." A doctor, who was present, and knew her age, said: "Do not fret
at it, madam; for you will get <i>further</i> from that frightful epoch every
day."</p>

<h4>MXXXV.&mdash;POT VALIANT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Provisions</span> have a greater influence on the valor of troops than is
generally supposed; and there is great truth in the remark of an English
physician, who said, that with a six weeks' diet he could make a man a
coward. A distinguished general was so convinced of this principle, that
he said he always employed his troops <i>before their dinner had
digested</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<h4>MXXXVI.&mdash;CAUSE AND EFFECT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir William Dawes</span>, Archbishop of York, was very fond of a pun. His
clergy dining with him, for the first time, after he had lost his lady,
he told them he feared they did not find things in so good order as they
used to be in the time of poor Mary; and, looking extremely sorrowful,
added, with a deep sigh, "She was, indeed, <i>Mare Pacificum</i>." A curate,
who pretty well knew what she had been, said, "Ay, my lord, but she was
<i>Mare Mortuum</i> first."</p>

<h4>MXXXVII.&mdash;A BAD PREACHER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A clergyman</span>, meeting a particular friend, asked him why he never came to
<i>hear him preach</i>. He answered, "I am afraid of <i>disturbing your
solitude</i>."</p>

<h4>MXXXVIII.&mdash;ON ROGERS THE POET, WHO WAS EGOTISTICAL.</h4>

<h4>MXXXIX.&mdash;A POSER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a Chancery suit one of the counsel, describing the boundaries of his
client's land, said, in showing the plan of it, "We lie on this side, my
lord." The opposite counsel then said, "And we lie on that side." The
Chancellor, with a good-humored grin, observed, "If you <i>lie</i> on both
sides, whom will you have me believe?"</p>

<h4>MXL.&mdash;A QUIET DOSE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A mean</span> fellow, thinking to get an opinion of his health <i>gratis</i>, asked
a medical acquaintance what he should take for such a complaint? "I'll
tell you," said the doctor, sarcastically; "You should take <i>advice</i>."</p>

<h4>MXLII.&mdash;AURICULAR CONFESSION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A cunning</span> juryman addressed the clerk of the court when administering
the oath, saying, "Speak up; I cannot hear what you say."&mdash;"Stop; are
you deaf?" asked Baron Alderson.&mdash;"Yes, of one ear."&mdash;"Then you may
leave the box, for it is necessary that jurymen should hear <i>both

<h4>MXLIII.&mdash;A DRY FELLOW.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Will," said an Earl one day to Will Speir, seeing the latter
finishing his dinner, "have you had a good dinner to-day?" (Will had
been grumbling some time before.) "Ou, vera gude," answered Will; "but
gin anybody asks if I got a dram <i>after 't</i>, what will I say?"</p>

<h4>MAXILLA.&mdash;GOOD EVIDENCE.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Did</span> you ever see Mr. Murdock return oats?" inquired the counsel.</p>

<p>"Yes, your honor," was the reply.</p>

<p>"On what <i>ground</i> did he refuse them?" was next asked by the learned
counsel.</p>

<p>"<i>In the back-yard</i>," said Teddy, amidst the laughter of the court.</p>

<h4>MXLVI.&mdash;QUIN AND THE PARSON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A well-beneficed</span> old parson having a large company to dinner,
entertained them with nothing else but the situation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> and profits of his
parochial livings, which he said he kept entirely to himself. Quin,
being one of the party, and observing that the parson displayed a pair
of very dirty yellow hands, immediately called out,&mdash;"So, so, doctor, I
think you do keep your <i>glebe</i> in your own hands with a witness!"</p>

<h4>MXLVII.&mdash;NATURAL ANTIPATHY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Foote</span> having satirized the Scotch pretty severely, a gentleman asked,
"Why he hated that nation so much."&mdash;"You are mistaken," said Foote, "I
don't hate the Scotch, neither do I hate frogs, but I would have
everything keep to its <i>native element</i>."</p>

<h4>MXLVIII.&mdash;NOT NECESSARY.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">You</span> flatter me," said a thin exquisite the other day to a young lady
who was praising the beauties of his moustache. "For heaven's sake,
ma'am," interposed an old skipper, "don't make that <i>monkey any flatter</i>
than he is!"</p>

<h4>MXLIX.&mdash;ASSURANCE AND INSURANCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sterne</span>, the author of the "Sentimental Journey," who had the credit of
treating his wife very ill, was one day talking to Garrick in a fine
sentimental manner in praise of conjugal love and fidelity: "The
husband," said he, with amazing assurance, "who behaves unkindly to his
wife, deserves to have his house burnt over his head."&mdash;"If you think
so," replied Garrick, "I hope <i>your</i> house is insured."</p>

<h4>ML.&mdash;CROMWELL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> being asked whom it was that he judged to be the chiefest actor in
the murder of the king, he answered in this short enigma or riddle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The heart of the loaf, and the head of the spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the name of the man that murdered the king."<br /></span>

<h4>MLI.&mdash;BILL PAID IN FULL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Wimpole there was to be seen a portrait of Mr. Harley, the speaker,
in his robes of office. The active<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> part he took to forward the bill to
settle the crown on the house of Hanover induced him to have a <i>scroll</i>
painted in his hand, bearing the title of that bill. Soon after George
the First arrived in England, Harley was sent to the <i>Tower</i>, and this
circumstance being told to Prior whilst he was viewing the portrait, he
wrote on the white part of the scroll the date of the day on which
Harley was committed to the Tower, and under it: "<span class="smcap">this bill paid in
full</span>."</p>

<h4>MLII.&mdash;WOMEN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> no time of life should a man give up the thoughts of enjoying the
society of women. "In youth," says Lord Bacon, "women are our
mistresses, at a riper age our companions, in old age our nurses, and in
all ages our friends."</p>

<p>A gentleman being asked what difference there was between a clock and a
woman, instantly replied, "A clock serves to <i>point</i> out the hours, and
a woman to make us <i>forget</i> them."</p>

<h4>MLIII.&mdash;THE DEVIL'S OWN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a review of the volunteers, when the half-drowned heroes were
defiling by all the best ways, the Devil's Own walked straight through.
This being reported to Lord B&mdash;&mdash;, he remarked, "that the lawyers always
went through <i>thick</i> and <i>thin</i>."</p>

<h4>MLIV.&mdash;WHIST-PLAYING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Lamb</span> said once to a brother whist-player, who was a hand more
clever than clean, and who had enough in him to afford the joke: "M., if
<i>dirt</i> were trumps, what <i>hands</i> you would hold!"</p>

<h4>MLV.&mdash;A CRUEL CASE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Pope</span> the actor, well known for his devotion to the culinary art,
received an invitation to dinner, accompanied by an apology for the
simplicity of the intended fare&mdash;a small turbot and a boiled edgebone of
beef. "The very thing of all others that I like," exclaimed Pope; "I
will come with the greatest pleasure": and come he did, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> eat he did,
till he could literally eat no longer; when the word was given, and a
haunch of venison was brought in. Poor Pope, after a puny effort at
trifling with a slice of fat, laid down his knife and fork, and gave way
to a hysterical burst of tears, exclaiming, "A friend of twenty years'
standing, and to be <i>served in this manner</i>!"</p>

<h4>MLVII.&mdash;WRITING TREASON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Horne Tooke</span>, on being asked by a foreigner of distinction how much
treason an Englishman might venture to write without being hanged,
replied, that "he could not inform him just yet, but that he was
<i>trying</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> resemblance between the sandal tree, imparting (while it falls) its

<h4>MLXI.&mdash;IN WANT OF A HUSBAND.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> lady was told by a married lady, that she had better precipitate

than <i>marry</i>. The young lady replied, "I would, if I thought I should
find a <i>husband</i> at the bottom."</p>

<h4>MLXII.&mdash;THREE ENDS TO A ROPE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lad</span> applied to the captain of a vessel for a berth; the captain,
wishing to intimidate him, handed him a piece of rope, and said, "If you
want to make a good sailor, you must make three ends to the rope."&mdash;"I
can do it," he readily replied; "here is one, and here is another,&mdash;that
makes two. Now, here's the <i>third</i>," and he threw it overboard.</p>

<h4>MLXIII.&mdash;THE REASON WHY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Foote</span> was once asked, why learned men are to be found in rich men's
houses, and rich men never to be seen in those of the learned. "Why,"
said he, "the <i>first</i> know what they want, but the <i>latter</i> do not."</p>

<h4>MLXIV.&mdash;PERSONALITIES OF GARRICK AND QUIN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Quin and Garrick performed at the same theatre, and in the same
play, one night, being very stormy, each ordered a chair. To the
mortification of Quin, Garrick's chair came up first. "Let me get into
the chair," cried the surly veteran, "let me get into the chair, and put
little Davy into the lantern."&mdash;"By all means," rejoined Garrick, "I
shall ever be happy <i>to enlighten</i> Mr. Quin in anything."</p>

<h4>MLXV.&mdash;BARK AND BITE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Clare</span>, who was much opposed to Curran, one day brought a
Newfoundland dog upon the bench, and during Curran's speech turned

rejoinder; "I really thought your lordship was employed in

<h4>MLXVI.&mdash;A PRESSING REASON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A tailor</span> sent his bill to a lawyer for money; the lawyer bid the boy
tell his master that he was not running away, but very busy at that
time. The boy comes again, and tells him he must have the money. "Did
you tell your master," said the lawyer, "that I was not running
away?"&mdash;"Yes, sir," answered the boy; "but he bade me tell you that <i>he
was</i>."</p>

<h4>MLXVII.&mdash;SMALL WIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir George Beaumont</span> once met Quin at a small dinner-party. There was a
delicious pudding, which the master of the house, pushing the dish
towards Quin, begged him to taste. A gentleman had just before helped
himself to an immense piece of it. "Pray," said Quin, looking first at
the gentleman's plate and then at the dish, "<i>which</i> is the pudding?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colman</span> and Banister dining one day with Lord Erskine, the ex-Chancellor,

Lane Theatre, and observing several engines hastening to the spot where
the fire had been extinguished, remarked that they were "<i>ingens</i> cui
lumen adeptum."</p>

<h4>MLXXII.&mdash;THROW PHYSIC TO THE DOGS!</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the celebrated Beau Nash was ill, Dr. Cheyne wrote a prescription
for him. The next day the doctor, coming to see his patient, inquired if

had I should have broken my neck for I <i>threw it</i> out of a
two-pair-of-stairs window."</p>

<h4>MLXXV.&mdash;A BALANCE.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Pay</span> me that six-and-eightpence you owe me, Mr. Malrooney," said a

<h4>MLXXVIII.&mdash;WRITING FOR THE STAGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">People</span> would be astonished if they were aware of the cart-loads of trash
which are annually offered to the director of a London theatre. The very
first manuscript (says George Colman) which was proposed to me for
representation, on my undertaking theatrical management, was from a
nautical gentleman, on a nautical subject; the piece was of a tragic
description, and in five acts; during the principal scenes of which the
hero of the drama declaimed from the <i>main-mast</i> of a man-of-war,
without once descending from his position!</p>

<p>A tragedy was offered to Mr. Macready, or Mr. Webster, in <i>thirty</i> acts.
The subject was the history of Poland, and the author proposed to have
five acts played a night, so that the whole could be gone through in a
week.</p>

<h4>MLXXIX.&mdash;A COMPARISON.</h4>

<h4>MLXXXIII.&mdash;JAMES SMITH AND JUSTICE HOLROYD.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Formerly</span>, it was customary, on emergencies, for the Judges to swear
affidavits at their dwelling-houses. Smith was desired by his father to
attend a Judge's chambers for that purpose; but being engaged to dine in
Russell Square, at the next house to Mr. Justice Holroyd's, he thought
he might as well save himself the disagreeable necessity of leaving the
party at eight, by despatching his business at once, so, a few minutes
before six, he boldly knocked at the Judge's and requested to speak to
him on particular business. The Judge was at dinner, but came down
without delay, swore the affidavit, and then gravely asked what was the
pressing necessity that induced our friend to disturb him at that hour.
As Smith told his story, he raked his invention for a lie, but finding
none fit for the purpose, he blurted out the truth: "The fact is, my
Lord, I am engaged to <i>dine</i> at the next house&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"And,
sir, you thought you might as well <i>save</i> your own dinner by <i>spoiling</i>
mine?"&mdash;"Exactly so, my Lord; but&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Sir, I wish you a good
evening." Though Smith brazened the matter out, he said he never was
more frightened.</p>

<h4>MLXXXIV.&mdash;A GOOD INVESTMENT.</h4>

<h4>MLXXXV.&mdash;THE AGED YOUNG LADY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old lady, being desirous to be thought younger than she was, said
that she was but <i>forty</i> years old. A student who sat near observed,
that it must be quite true, for he had heard her repeat the same for the
last <i>ten years</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<h4>MLXXXVI&mdash;KEEPING TIME.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Duke of B&mdash;&mdash;, who was to have been one of the knights of the
Eglinton tournament, was lamenting that he was obliged to excuse
himself, on the ground of an attack of the gout. "How," said he, "could
I ever get my poor puffed legs into those abominable iron boots?"&mdash;"It
will be quite as appropriate," replied Hook, "if your grace goes in your
<i>list</i> shoes."</p>

<h4>MLXXXVIII.&mdash;NOT IMPORTUNATE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Robison</span> (widow of the eminent professor of natural philosophy)

accepted, with the reservation, "If I am spared."&mdash;"Weel, weel," said
Mrs. Robison, "if ye're <i>dead</i> I'll no' expect ye."</p>

<h4>MLXXXIX.&mdash;WITTY COWARD.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A French</span> marquis having received several blows with a stick, which he
never thought of resenting, a friend asked him, "How he could reconcile
it with his honor to suffer them to pass without notice?"&mdash;"Pooh!"
replied the marquis, "I never trouble my head with anything that passes
behind my back."</p>

<h4>MXC.&mdash;PRIORITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old Scotch domestic gave a capital reason to his <i>young</i> master for
his being allowed to do as he liked: "Ye need na find faut wi' me,
Maister Jeems, <i>I hae been langer about the place than yersel'</i>."</p>

<h4>MXCI.&mdash;SHOULD NOT SILENCE GIVE CONSENT?</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A laird</span> of Logan was at a meeting of the heritors of Cumnock, where a
proposal was made to erect a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> churchyard wall. He met the
proposition with the dry remark, "I never big dykes till the <i>tenants</i>
complain."</p>

<h4>MXCII.&mdash;CHARACTERISTICS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Dr. Brand was remarkable for his spirit of contradiction. One
extremely cold morning, in the month of January, he was addressed by a
friend with,&mdash;"It is a very cold morning, doctor."&mdash;"I don't know that,"
was the doctor's observation, though he was at the instant covered with
<i>snow</i>. At another time he happened to dine with some gentlemen. The
doctor engrossed the conversation almost entirely to himself, and
interlarded his observations with Greek and Latin quotations, to the
annoyance of the company. A gentleman of no slight erudition, seated
next the doctor, remarked to him, "that he ought not to quote so much,
as many of the party did not understand it."&mdash;"And <i>you are one</i> of
them," observed the learned bear.</p>

<h4>MXCIII.&mdash;AN ERROR CORRECTED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerrold</span> was seriously disappointed with a certain book written by one of
his friends. This friend heard that Jerrold had expressed his
disappointment.</p>

<p><i>Friend</i> (to Jerrold).&mdash;I hear you said &mdash;&mdash; was the worst book I ever
wrote.</p>

<p><i>Jerrold.</i>&mdash;No, I didn't. I said it was the worst book anybody ever

<h4>MXCV.&mdash;BRAHAM AND KENNEY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pride of some people differs from that of others. Mr. Bunn was
passing through Jermyn Street, late one evening, and seeing Kenney at
the corner of St. James's Church, swinging about in a nervous sort of
manner, he inquired the cause of his being there at such an hour. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
replied, "I have been to the St. James's Theatre, and, do you know, I
really thought Braham was a much prouder man than I find him to be." On
asking why, he answered, "I was in the green-room, and hearing Braham
say, as he entered, 'I am really <i>proud</i> of my pit to-night,' I went and
counted it, and there were but <i>seventeen</i> people in it."</p>

<h4>MXCVII.&mdash;A BED OF&mdash;WHERE?</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Scotch</span> country minister had been invited, with his wife, to dine and
spend the night at the house of one of his lairds. Their host was very
proud of one of the very large beds which had just come into fashion,
and in the morning asked the lady how she had slept in it. "O very well,
sir; but, indeed, I thought <i>I'd lost</i> the minister a' thegither."</p>

<h4>MXCVIII.&mdash;ENVY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A drunken</span> man was found in the suburbs of Dublin, lying on his face, by
the roadside, apparently in a state of physical unconsciousness. "He is
dead," said a countryman of his, who was looking at him. "Dead!" replied
another, who had turned him with his face uppermost; "by the powers, <i>I
wish I had just half his disease</i>!"&mdash;in other words, a moiety of the
whiskey he had drunk.</p>

<h4>MXCIX.&mdash;A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I keep</span> an excellent table," said a lady, disputing with one of her
boarders. "That may be true, ma'am," says he, "but you put very little
<i>upon it</i>."</p>

<h4>MC.&mdash;MORE HONORED IN THE BREACH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A laird of Logan</span> sold a horse to an Englishman, saying, "You buy him as
you see him; but he's an <i>honest</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> beast." The purchaser took him home.
In a few days he stumbled and fell, to the damage of his own knees and
his rider's head. On this the angry purchaser remonstrated with the
laird, whose reply was, "Well, sir, I told you he was an honest beast;
many a time has he <i>threatened</i> to come down with me, and I kenned he
would <i>keep his word</i> some day."</p>

<h4>MCI.&mdash;"YOU'LL GET THERE BEFORE I CAN TELL YOU."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Neville</span>, formerly a fellow of Jesus College, was distinguished, by
many innocent singularities, uncommon shyness, and stammering of speech,
but when he used <i>bad</i> words he could talk fluently. In one of his
solitary rambles a countryman met him and inquired the road.
"Tu&mdash;u&mdash;rn," says Neville, "to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;" and so on for a minute or two;
at last he burst out, "<i>Confound it, man! you'll get there before I can
tell you</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCIII.&mdash;A LONG RESIDENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following complacent Scottish remark upon Bannockburn was made to a
splenetic Englishman, who had said to a Scottish countryman that no man
of taste would think of remaining any time in such a country as
Scotland. To which the canny Scot replied, "Tastes differ; I'se tak' ye
to a place no far frae Stirling, whaur thretty thousand o' yer

<h4>MCVIII.&mdash;ELLISTON AND GEORGE IV.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1824, when the question of erecting a monument to Shakespeare, in his
native town, was agitated by Mr. Mathews and Mr. Bunn, the King (George
IV.) took a lively interest in the matter, and, considering that the
leading people of both the patent theatres should be consulted, directed
Sir Charles Long, Sir George Beaumont, and Sir Francis Freeling to
ascertain Mr. Elliston's sentiments on the subject. As soon as these
distinguished individuals (who had come direct from, and were going
direct back to, the Palace) had delivered themselves of their mission,
Elliston replied, "Very well, gentlemen, leave the papers with me, and
<i>I will talk over the business with</i> <span class="smcap">his Majesty</span>."</p>

<h4>MCIX.&mdash;TRUTH AND FICTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A traveller</span> relating his adventures, told the company that he and his

<h4>MCX.&mdash;A REASONABLE REFUSAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of expected invasion at the beginning of the century, some
of the town magistrates called upon an old maiden lady of Montrose, and
solicited her subscription to raise men for the service of the King.
"Indeed," she answered right sturdily, "I'll do nae sic thing; I never
could raise a man <i>for mysel</i>, and I'm no gaun to raise men for King
George."</p>

<h4>MCXI.&mdash;LORD NORTH'S DROLLERY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A vehement</span> political declaimer, calling aloud for the head of Lord
North, turned round and perceived his victim unconsciously indulging in
a quiet slumber, and, becoming still more exasperated, denounced the
Minister as capable of sleeping while he ruined his country; the latter
only complained how cruel it was to be denied a solace which other
criminals so often enjoyed, that of having a night's rest before their
fate. On Mr. Martin's proposal to have a starling placed near the chair,
and taught to repeat the cry of "<i>Infamous coalition</i>!" Lord North
coolly suggested, that, as long as the worthy member was preserved to
them, it would be a needless waste of the public money, since the
starling might well perform his office <i>by deputy</i>.</p>

and stopping him, desired to know, "Whether he had succeeded?" His

"<i>Sixpence</i>!" replied the Cantab, "which I gave the man for bringing the
note."</p>

</div></div>

<h4>MCXVIII.&mdash;NO MATTER WHAT COLOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> eminent Scottish divine met two of his own parishioners at the house
of a lawyer, whom he considered too sharp a practitioner. The lawyer
ungraciously put the question, "Doctor, these are members of your flock;
may I ask, do you look upon them as white sheep or as black sheep?"&mdash;"I
don't know," answered the divine dryly, "whether they are black or white
sheep; but I know, if they are long here, they are pretty sure to be
<i>fleeced</i>."</p>

<h4>MCXIX.&mdash;AN ODD OCCURRENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a wedding the other day one of the guests, who often is a little
absent-minded, observed gravely, "I have often remarked that there have

<h4>MCXX.&mdash;A DANGEROUS GENERALIZATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A tutor</span> bidding one of his pupils, whose name was Charles Howl, to make
some English verses, and seeing he put <i>teeth</i> to rhyme with <i>feet</i>,
told him he was wrong there, as that was no proper rhyme. Charles
answered, "You have often told me that H was no letter, and therefore
this is good rhyme." His tutor said, "Take heed, Charles, of that
evasion, for that will make you an <i>owl</i>."</p>

<h4>MCXXI.&mdash;NOSCE TE IPSUM.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheridan</span> was one day much annoyed by a fellow-member of the House of
Commons, who kept crying out every few minutes, "Hear! hear!" During the
debate he took occasion to describe a political contemporary that wished
to play rogue, but had only sense enough to act fool. "Where," exclaimed
he, with great emphasis&mdash;"where shall we find a more foolish knave or a
more <i>knavish fool</i> than he?"&mdash;"Hear! hear!" was shouted by the
troublesome member. Sheridan turned round, and, thanking him for the
prompt information, sat down amid a general roar of laughter.</p>

<h4>MCXXIII.&mdash;TIMELY AID.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> was followed by a beggar, who very importunately asked her for
alms. She refused him; when he quitted her, saying, with a profound
sigh, "Yet the alms I asked you for would have prevented me executing my
present resolution!" The lady was alarmed lest the man should commit
some rash attempt on his own life. She called him back, and gave him a
shilling, and asked him the meaning of what he had just said. "Madam,"
said the fellow, laying hold of the money, "I have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> <i>begging</i> all
day in vain, and but for this shilling I should have been obliged to

<h4>MCXXIV.&mdash;WHIST.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bray</span> relates the following of a Devonshire physician, happily named
Vial, who was a desperate lover of whist. One evening in the midst of a
deal, the doctor fell off his chair in a fit. Consternation seized on
the company. Was he alive or dead? At length he showed signs of life,
and, retaining the last fond idea which had possessed him at the moment
he fell into the fit, exclaimed, "<i>What is trumps</i>?"</p>

<h4>MCXXV.&mdash;HENRY ERSKINE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Hon. Henry Erskine met his acquaintance Jemmy Ba&mdash;four, a
barrister, who dealt in hard words and circumlocutious sentences.
Perceiving that his ankle was tied up with a silk handkerchief, the
former asked the cause. "Why, my dear sir," answered the wordy lawyer,
"I was taking a romantic ramble in my brother's grounds, when, coming to
a gate, I had to climb over it, by which I came in contact with the
first bar, and have grazed the epidermis on my skin, attended with a
slight extravasation of blood."&mdash;"You may thank your lucky stars,"
replied Mr. Erskine, "that your brother's <i>gate</i> was not as <i>lofty</i> as
your <i>style</i>, or you must have broken your neck."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A foreigner</span> asked an English tailor how much cloth was necessary for a
suit of clothes. He replied, <i>twelve</i> yards. Astonished at the quantity,
he went to another, who said <i>seven</i> would be quite sufficient. Not
thinking of the exorbitancy even of this demand, all his rage was
against the first tailor: so to him he went. "How did you dare, sir, ask
twelve yards of cloth, to make me what your neighbor says he can do for
seven?"&mdash;"Lord, sir!" replied the man, "my neighbor can easily do it, he
has but <i>three</i> children to clothe, I have <i>six</i>."</p>

that came uppermost, that he might observe how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> it could be heard. "Why
then, Sir Richard," says the fellow, "here have we been working for you
these six months, and cannot get one penny of money. Pray, sir, when do

small part of the candles, he took them with him into his bedroom. In
the morning, finding he was charged 2s. in his bill for wax candles,
instead of fees to the waiter and chambermaid, he <i>gave to each a wax
candle</i>.</p>

<h4>MCLXXXVII.&mdash;A FULL HOUSE.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> plan," said an actor to another, "shall I adopt to fill the house
at my benefit?"&mdash;"<i>Invite your creditors</i>," was the surly reply.</p>

<h4>MCLXXXVIII.&mdash;RATHER THE WORST HALF.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> one occasion a lad, while at home for the holidays, complained to his
mother that a schoolfellow who slept with him took up half the bed. "And
why not?" said the mother; "he's entitled to half, isn't he!"&mdash;"Yes,
mother," rejoined her son; "but how would you like to have him take out
all the soft for his half? He will have <i>his</i> half out of the middle,
and I have to sleep <i>both</i> sides of him!"</p>

<h4>MCLXXXIX.&mdash;FORCE OF HABIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A servant</span> of an old maiden lady, a patient of Dr. Poole, formerly of
Edinburgh, was under orders to go to the doctor every morning to report
the state of her health, how she had slept, &amp;c., with strict injunctions
<i>always</i> to add, "with her compliments." At length, one morning the girl
brought this extraordinary message: "Miss S&mdash;&mdash;'s <i>compliments</i>, and she
de'ed last night at aicht o'clock!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<h4>MCXC.&mdash;A WONDERFUL SIGHT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A jolly</span> Jack-tar having strayed into Atkins's show at Bartholomew Fair,
to have a look at the wild beasts, was much struck with the sight of a
lion and a tiger in the same den. "Why, Jack," said he to a messmate,
who was chewing a quid in silent amazement, "I shouldn't wonder if next
year they were to carry about a <i>sailor and a marine living peaceably
together</i>!"&mdash;"Aye," said his married companion, "or a <i>man and wife</i>."</p>

<h4>MCXCI.&mdash;BURKE AND FOX.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Burke</span>, in speaking of the indisposition of Mr. Fox, which prevented
his making a motion for an investigation into the conduct of Lord
Sandwich, said, "No one laments Mr. Fox's illness more than I do; and I
declare that if he should continue ill, the inquiry into the conduct of
the first Lord of the Admiralty should not be proceeded upon; and,
should the country suffer so serious a calamity as his death, it ought
to be followed up earnestly and solemnly; nay, of so much consequence is
the inquiry to the public, that no bad use would be made of the skin of
my departed friend, (should such, alas! be his fate!) if, like that of
John Zisca, it should be converted <i>into a drum</i>, and used for the
purpose of sounding an alarm to the people of England."</p>

<h4>MCXCII.&mdash;TRYING TO THE TEMPER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Allen</span>, in conversation with Rogers, the poet, observed: "I never
put my razor into hot water, as I find it injures the temper of the
blade."&mdash;"No doubt of it," replied Rogers; "show me the blade that is
<i>not out of temper</i> when plunged into <i>hot water</i>."</p>

<h4>MCXCIII.&mdash;HAVING A CALL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Dunlop</span>, while making his pastoral visitations among some of the
country members of his flock, came to a farm-house where he was
expected; and the mistress, thinking that he would be in need of
refreshment, proposed that he should take his tea before engaging in
<i>exercises</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> and said she would soon have it ready. Mr. Dunlop replied,
"I aye tak' my tea better when my wark's dune. I'll just be gaun on. Ye
can hing the pan on, an' lea' the door ajar, an' I'll draw to a close in
the prayer when I hear the <i>haam fizzin'</i>."</p>

<h4>MCXCIV.&mdash;A WILL AND AWAY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a strange instance of alleged obedience to orders in the case of
a father's will, which a brute of a fellow displayed in turning his
younger brother out-of-doors. He was vociferously remonstrated with by
the neighbors on the gross impropriety of such conduct. "Sure," said he,
"it's the will; I'm ordered to <i>divide</i> the house betune myself and my
brother, so I've taken the <i>inside</i> and given him the <i>outside</i>."</p>

<h4>MCXCV.&mdash;A WINDY MINISTER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of our northern counties, a rural district had its harvest
operations seriously affected by continuous rains. The crops being much
laid, wind was desired in order to restore them to a condition fit for
the sickle. A minister, in his Sabbath services, expressed their wants
in prayer as follows:&mdash;"Send us wind, no a rantin', tantin', tearin'
wind, but a noohin' (noughin?), soughin', winnin' wind." More expressive
words than these could not be found in any language.</p>

<h4>MCXCVI.&mdash;READY RECKONER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Duke of Wellington, when Premier, was the terror of the idlers in
Downing Street. On one occasion when the Treasury clerks told him that
some required mode of making up the accounts was impracticable, they
were met with the curt reply: "Never mind, if you can't do it, I'll send
you half-a-dozen <i>pay sergeants</i> that will,"&mdash;a hint that they did not
fail to take.</p>

<h4>MCXCVII.&mdash;A "DISTANT" FRIEND.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeting</span> a negro on the road, a traveller said, "You have lost some of
your friends, I see?"&mdash;"Yes, massa."&mdash;"Was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> it a near or a distant
relative?"&mdash;"Well, purty distant,&mdash;<i>'bout twenty-four mile</i>," was the
reply.</p>

<h4>MCXCVIII.&mdash;TYPOGRAPHICAL WIT.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">Ho</span>! Tommy," bawls Type, to a brother in trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The ministry are to be <i>changed</i>, it is said."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That's good," replied Tom, "but it better would be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a trifling erratum."&mdash;"What?"&mdash;"Dele the <i>c</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>MCXCIX.&mdash;A NAMELESS MAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span>, thinking he was charged too much by a porter for the
delivery of a parcel, asked him what his name was. "My name," replied
the man, "is the same as my father's."&mdash;"And what is his name?" said the
gentleman. "It is the same as mine."&mdash;"Then what are both your
names?"&mdash;"Why, they <i>are both alike</i>," answered the man again, and very
deliberately walked off.</p>

<h4>MCC.&mdash;AN INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Booth</span>, the tragedian, had a broken nose. A lady once remarked to him, "I
like your acting, Mr. Booth; but, to be frank with you,&mdash;<i>I can't get
over your nose</i>!"&mdash;"No wonder, madam," replied he, "the bridge is gone!"</p>

<h4>MCCI.&mdash;NON COMPOS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is remarkable that &mdash;&mdash; is of an exceedingly cheerful disposition,
though the <i>very little piece</i> of mind he possesses is proverbial.</p>

<h4>MCCII.&mdash;TOO LIBERAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A writer</span> in one of the Reviews was boasting that he was in the habit of
distributing literary reputation. "Yes," replied his friend, "and you
have done it so profusely that you have <i>left none</i> for yourself."</p>

<h4>MCCIII.&mdash;A LITTLE RAIN.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">How</span> monarchs die is easily explained,<br /></span>

<h4>MCCIV.&mdash;TRUE DIGNITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">P&mdash;&mdash;</span> had a high respect for the literary character. At a great man's
house a stranger stopped that P&mdash;&mdash; might enter the room before him.
"Pass, sir," said the master of the house, "it is only Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, the
author."&mdash;"As my rank is mentioned," cried P., "I shall claim the
preference"; and accordingly took the lead.</p>

<h4>MCCV.&mdash;HOW TO GET RID OF AN ENEMY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Mead</span>, calling one day on a gentleman who had been severely afflicted
with the gout, found, to his surprise, the disease gone, and the patient
rejoicing on his recovery over a bottle of wine. "Ah!" said the doctor,
shaking his head, "this Madeira will never do; it is the cause of all
your suffering."&mdash;"Well, then," rejoined the gay incurable, "fill your
glass, for now we have found out <i>the cause</i>, the sooner <i>we get rid of
it</i> the better."</p>

<h4>MCCVI.&mdash;SEVERE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> asked a sailor whom she met, why a ship was called "<i>she</i>." The
son of Neptune replied that it was "because the <i>rigging</i> cost more than
the hull."</p>

<h4>MCCVII.&mdash;NO SACRIFICE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A linen-draper</span> having advertised his stock to be sold under <i>prime
cost</i>, a neighbor observed that, "It was impossible, as he had never
<i>paid a farthing for it himself</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCVIII.&mdash;SHARP BOY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A mother</span> admonishing her son (a lad about seven years of age), told him
he should never <i>defer</i> till to-morrow what he could do to-day. The
little urchin replied, "Then, mother, let's eat the remainder of the
plum-pudding <i>to-night</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCIX.&mdash;EARLY BIRDS OF PREY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A merchant</span> having been attacked by some thieves at five in the
afternoon, said: "Gentlemen, you <i>open shop early</i> to-day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<h4>MCCX.&mdash;JUDGMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">James the Second</span>, when Duke of York, made a visit to Milton the poet,
and asked him, amongst other things, if he did not think the loss of his
sight a <i>judgment</i> upon him for what he had written against his father,
Charles the First. Milton answered, "If your Highness think my loss of
sight a <i>judgment</i> upon me, what do you think of your father's losing
his head?"</p>

<h4>MCCXI.&mdash;ON A LADY WHO WAS PAINTED.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">It</span> sounds like paradox,&mdash;and yet 'tis true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You're like your picture, though it's not like you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>MCCXII.&mdash;RATHER A-CURATE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is strange that the Church dignitaries, the further they advance in
their profession, become the more incorrigible; at least, before they
have gone many steps, they may be said to be <i>past a</i> <span class="smcap">cure</span>.</p>

<h4>MCCXIII.&mdash;MONEY'S WORTH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A rich</span> upstart once asked a poor person if he had any idea of the
advantages arising from riches. "I believe they give a rogue <i>an
advantage</i> over an honest man," was the reply.</p>

<h4>MCCXIV.&mdash;THE RICHMOND HOAX.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the best practical jokes in Theodore Hook's clever "Gilbert
Gurney," is Daly's hoax upon the lady who had never been at Richmond
before, or, at least, knew none of the peculiarities of the place. Daly
desired the waiter, after dinner, to bring some "maids of honor"&mdash;those
cheesecakes for which the place has, time out of mind, been celebrated.
The lady stared, then laughed, and asked, "What do you mean by 'maids of
honor?'"&mdash;"Dear me!" said Daly, "don't you know that this is so courtly
a place, and so completely under the influence of state etiquette, that
everything in Richmond is called after the functionaries of the palace?
What are called cheesecakes elsewhere, are here called maids of honor;
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> capon is called a lord chamberlain; a goose is a lord steward; a
roast pig is a master of the horse; a pair of ducks, grooms of the
bedchamber; a gooseberry-tart, a gentleman usher of the black rod; and
so on." The unsophisticated lady was taken in, when she actually saw the
maids of honor make their appearance in the shape of cheesecakes; she
convulsed the whole party by turning to the waiter, and desiring him, in
a sweet but decided tone, to bring her a <i>gentleman usher of the black
rod</i>, if they had one in the house quite cold!</p>

<h4>MCCX.V.&mdash;LORD CHATHAM.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chatham</span> had settled a plan for some sea expedition he had in view,
and sent orders to Lord Anson to see the necessary arrangements taken
immediately. Mr. Cleveland was sent from the Admiralty to remonstrate on
the impossibility of obeying them. He found his lordship in the most
excruciating pain, from one of the most severe fits of the gout he had
ever experienced. "Impossible, sir," said he, "don't talk to me of
impossibilities": and then, raising himself upon his legs, while the
sweat stood in large drops upon his forehead, and every fibre of his
body was convulsed with agony, "Go, sir, and tell his lordship, that he
has to do with a minister who actually <i>treads</i> on impossibilities."</p>

<h4>MCCXVI.&mdash;"I CAN GET THROUGH."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the cloisters of Trinity College, beneath the library, are grated
windows, through which many of the students have occasionally, after the
gates were locked, taken the liberty of passing, without an <i>exeat</i>, in
rather a novel style. A certain Cantab was in the act of drawing himself
through the bars, and being more than an ordinary mortal's bulk, he
stuck fast. One of the fellows of the college passing, stepped up to the
student and asked him ironically, "If he should assist him?"&mdash;"Thank
you," was the reply, "<i>I can get through</i>!" at the same instant he drew
himself back on the outside.</p>

<h4>MCCXVII.&mdash;MAKING FREE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Formerly</span>, members of parliament had the privilege of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> franking letters
sent by post. When this was so, a sender on one occasion applied to the
post-office to know why some of his franked letters had been <i>charged</i>.
He was told that the name on the letter did not appear to be in his
handwriting. "It was not," he replied, "<i>precisely</i> the same; but the
truth is, I happened to be a <i>little tipsy</i> when I franked
them."&mdash;"Then, sir, will you be so good in future as to write <i>drunk</i>
when you make <i>free</i>?"</p>

<h4>MCCXVIII.&mdash;FICTION AND TRUTH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Waller</span>, the poet, who was bred at King's College, wrote a fine panegyric
on Cromwell, when he assumed the protectorship. Upon the restoration of
Charles, Waller wrote another in praise of him, and presented it to the
king in person. After his majesty had read the poem, he told Waller that
he wrote a better on Cromwell. "Please your majesty," said Waller, like
a true courtier, "we poets are always more happy in <i>fiction</i> than in
<i>truth</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXIX.&mdash;A TAVERN DINNER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A party</span> of <i>bon-vivants</i>, having drunk an immense quantity of wine, rang
for the bill. The bill was accordingly brought, but the amount appeared
so enormous to one of the company (not quite so far gone as the rest)
that he stammered out, it was impossible so many bottles could have been
drunk by seven persons. "True, sir," said the waiter, "but your honor
forgets the three gentlemen <i>under the table</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXX.&mdash;A FULL STOP.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> was speaking of the kindness of his friends in visiting him.
One old aunt, in particular, visited him <i>twice</i> a year, and stayed <i>six
months</i> each time.</p>

<h4>MCCXXI.&mdash;FAT AND LEAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span>, praising porter, said it was so excellent a beverage, that,
though taken in great quantities, it always made him fat. "I have seen
the time," said another, "when it made you lean,"&mdash;"When? I should be
glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> to know," inquired the eulogist. "Why, no longer ago than last
night,&mdash;<i>against a wall</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXXII.&mdash;SELF-CONDEMNATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph II.</span>, emperor of Germany, travelling in his usual way, without his
retinue, attended by only a single aide-de-camp, arrived very late at
the house of an Englishman, who kept an inn in the Netherlands. After
eating a few slices of ham and biscuit, the emperor and his attendant
retired to rest, and in the morning paid their bill, which amounted to
only three shillings and sixpence, English, and rode off. A few hours
afterwards, several of his suite arrived, and the publican,
understanding the rank of his guest, appeared very uneasy. "Psha! psha!
man," said one of the attendants, "Joseph is accustomed to such
adventures, and will think no more of it."&mdash;"But I <i>shall</i>" replied the
landlord; "and never forgive myself for having had an emperor in my
house, and letting him off for <i>three and sixpence</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXXIII.&mdash;NICKNAMES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">John Magee</span>, formerly the printer of the <i>Dublin Evening Post</i>, was full
of shrewdness and eccentricity. Several prosecutions were instituted
against him by the government, and many "keen encounters of the tongue"
took place on these occasions between him and John Scott, Lord Clonmel,
who was at that period Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In addressing
the Court in his own defence, Magee had occasion to allude to some
public character, who was better known by a familiar designation. The
official gravity of Clonmel was disturbed; and he, with bilious
asperity, reproved the printer, by saying, "Mr. Magee, we allow no
nicknames in this court,"&mdash;-"Very well, <i>John Scott,</i>" was the reply.</p>

<h4>MCCXXIV.&mdash;A CALCULATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the death of the poet Chatterton, there was found among his
papers, indorsed on a letter intended for publication, addressed to
Beckford, then Lord Mayor, dated May 26, 1770, the following memorandum:
"Accepted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> by Bingley, set for, and thrown out of, the <i>North Briton</i>,
21st June, on account of the Lord Mayor's death:&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>Yet the evident heartlessness of this calculation has been ingeniously
vindicated by Southey, in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

<h4>MCCXXV.&mdash;ON THE PRICE OF ADMISSION TO SEE THE MAMMOTH HORSE.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">I would</span> not pay a coin to see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An animal much larger;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely the mammoth horse must be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rather an <i>overcharger</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>MCCXXVI.&mdash;NOTHING BUT HEBREW.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Cantab</span> chanced to enter a strange church, and after he had been seated
some little time, another person was ushered into the same pew with him.
The stranger pulled out of his pocket a prayer-book, and offered to
share it with the Cantab, though he perceived he had one in his hand.
This courtesy proceeded from a mere ostentatious display of his
learning, as it proved to be in <i>Latin</i>. The Cantab immediately declined
the offer by saying, "Sir, I read nothing but <i>Hebrew</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCCXXVII.&mdash;A GOOD RECOMMENDATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Captain Grose, who was very fat, first went over to Ireland, he one
evening strolled into the principal meat market of Dublin, where the
butchers, as usual, set up their usual cry of "What d'ye buy? What d'ye
buy?" Grose parried this for some time by saying he did not want
anything. At last, a butcher starts from his stall, and eyeing Grose's
figure, exclaimed, "Only <i>say</i> you buy your meat of me, sir, and you
will make my fortune."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<h4>MCCXXVIII.&mdash;QUID PRO QUO.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> Irish lawyer, famed for cross-examining, was, on one occasion,
completely silenced by a horse-dealer. "Pray, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, you belong to a
very honest profession?"&mdash;"I can't say so," replied the witness; "for,
saving you <i>lawyers</i>, I think it the <i>most dishonest going</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXXIX.&mdash;SERVANTS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an observation of Elwes, the noted miser, that if you keep <i>one</i>
servant your work will be done; if you keep <i>two</i>, it will be half done;
and if you keep <i>three</i>, you will have to do it yourself.</p>

<h4>MCCXXX.&mdash;PLAIN ENOUGH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span>, praising the personal charms of a very plain woman in the
presence of Foote, the latter said: "And why don't you lay claim to such
an accomplished beauty?"&mdash;"What right have I to her?" exclaimed the
gentleman. "Every right, by the law of nations," replied Foote; "every
right, as the <i>first discoverer</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXXXI.&mdash;A POSER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Plymouth there is, or was, a small green opposite the Government
House, over which no one was permitted to pass. Not a creature was
allowed to approach, save the General's cow. One day old Lady D&mdash;&mdash;,
having called at the General's, in order to make a short cut, bent her
steps across the lawn, when she was arrested by the sentry calling out,
and desiring her to return. "But," said lady D&mdash;&mdash;, with a stately air,
"do you know who I am?"&mdash;"I don't know who you be, ma'am," replied the
immovable sentry, "but I knows you b'aint&mdash;you b'aint the <i>General's
cow</i>." So Lady D&mdash;&mdash; wisely gave up the argument, and went the other
way.</p>

<h4>MCCXXXII.&mdash;TRUE CRITICISM.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> being prevailed upon to taste a lady's home-made wine, was
asked for an opinion of what he had tasted. "I always give a candid
one," said her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> guest, "where eating and drinking are concerned. <i>It is
admirable stuff to catch flies</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXXXIII.&mdash;ORIGIN OF THE TERM GROG.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> British sailors had always been accustomed to drink their allowance
of brandy or rum clear, till Admiral Vernon ordered those under his
command to mix it with water. The innovation gave great offence to the
sailors, and for a time rendered the commander very unpopular among
them. The admiral at that time wore a grogram coat, for which reason
they nicknamed him "Old Grog," &amp;c. Hence, by degrees, the mixed liquor
he constrained them to drink universally obtained among them the name of
<i>grog</i>.</p>

<h4>MCCXXXIV.&mdash;WELL SAID.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span>, speaking of the happiness of the married state before his
daughter, disparagingly said, "She who marries, does well; but she who
does not marry, does better."&mdash;"Well then," said the young lady, "I will
<i>do well</i>; let those who choose <i>do better</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXXXV.&mdash;SLEEPING AT CHURCH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. South</span>, when once preaching before Charles II., observed that the
monarch and his attendants began to nod, and some of them soon after
snored, on which he broke off in his sermon, and said: "Lord Lauderdale,
let me entreat you to rouse yourself; you snore so loud that you will
<i>awake the king</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCCXXXVI.&mdash;SHERIDAN CONVIVIAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Byron</span> notes: "What a wreck is Sheridan! and all from bad pilotage;
for no one had ever better gales, though now and then a little squally.
Poor dear Sherry! I shall never forget the day he, and Rogers, and
Moore, and I passed together, when <i>he</i> talked and we listened, without
one yawn, from six to one in the morning."</p>

<p>One night, Sheridan was found in the street by a watchman, bereft of
that "divine particle of air" called reason, and fuddled, and
bewildered, and almost insensible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> The watchman asked, "Who are you,
sir?" No answer. "What's your name?" A hiccup. "What's your name?"
Answer, in a slow, deliberate, and impassive tone, "Wilberforce!" Byron
notes: "Is not that Sherry all over?&mdash;and, to my mind, excellent. Poor
fellow! <i>his</i> very dregs are better than the first sprightly runnings of
others."</p>

<h4>MCCXXXVII.&mdash;THE WORST OF TWO EVILS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Villiers</span>, Duke of Buckingham, in King Charles II.'s time, was saying one
day to Sir Robert Viner, in a melancholy humor: "I am afraid, Sir
Robert, I shall die a beggar at last, which is the most terrible thing
in the world."&mdash;"Upon my word, my lord," said Sir Robert, "there is
another thing more terrible which you have to apprehend, and that is
that you will <i>live</i> a beggar, at the rate you go on."</p>

<h4>MCCXXXVIII.&mdash;QUID PRO QUO.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A worthy</span> Roman Catholic clergyman, well known as "Priest Matheson," and
universally respected in the district, had charge of a mission in
Aberdeenshire, and for a long time made his journeys on a piebald pony,
the priest and his "Pyet Shelty" sharing an affectionate recognition
wherever they came. On one occasion, however, he made his appearance on
a steed of a different description, and passing near a Seceding
meeting-house, he forgathered with the minister, who, after the usual
kindly greetings, missing the familiar pony, said, "Ou, priest! fat's
come o' the auld Pyet?"&mdash;"He's deid, minister."&mdash;"Weel, he was an auld
faithfu' servant, and ye wad nae doot gie him the offices o' the
Church?"&mdash;"Na, minister," said his friend, not quite liking this
allusion to his priestly offices, "I didna dee that, for ye see he
<i>turned Seceder afore he deed, an' I buried him like a beast</i>." He then
rode quietly away.</p>

<h4>MCCXXXIX.&mdash;CREDIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the witty aphorisms upon this unsafe topic, are Lord Alvanley's
description of a man who "muddled away his fortune in paying his
tradesmen's bills"; Lord Orford's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> definition of timber, "an excrescence
on the face of the earth, placed there by Providence for the payment of
debts"; and Pelham's argument, that it is <i>respectable to be arrested</i>,
because it shows that the party once had credit.</p>

<h4>MCCXL.&mdash;SEEING NOT BELIEVING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady's-maid</span> told her mistress that she once swallowed several pins
together. "Dear me!" said the lady, "didn't they <i>kill you</i>?"</p>

<h4>MCCXLI.&mdash;SPIRIT OF A GAMBLER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A bon-vivant</span>, brought to his death-bed by an immoderate use of wine,
after having been told that he could not in all human probability
survive many hours, and would die by eight o clock next morning, exerted
the small remains of his strength to call the doctor back, and said,
with the true spirit of a gambler, "doctor, I'll bet you a bottle I
<i>live till nine</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCCXLII.&mdash;BURKE'S TEDIOUSNESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> upon great occasions Burke was one of the most eloquent of men
that ever sat in the British senate, he had in ordinary matters as much
as any man the faculty of tiring his auditors. During the latter years
of his life the failing gained so much upon him, that he more than once
dispersed the house, a circumstance which procured him the nickname of
the Dinner-bell. A gentleman was one day going into the House, when he
was surprised to meet a great number of people coming out in a body. "Is
the House up?" said he: "No," answered one of the fugitives, "but Mr.
Burke <i>is up</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXLIII.&mdash;VERY LIKE EACH OTHER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> appears that there were two persons of the name of Dr. John Thomas,
not easily to be distinguished; for somebody (says Bishop Newton) was
speaking of Dr. Thomas, when it was asked, "which Dr. Thomas do you
mean?"&mdash;"Dr. John Thomas."&mdash;"They are both named John."&mdash;"Dr. Thomas who
has a living in the city."&mdash;"They have both livings in the city."&mdash;"Dr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Thomas who is chaplain to the king."&mdash;"They are both chaplains to the
king."&mdash;"Dr. Thomas who is a very good preacher."&mdash;"They are both good
preachers."&mdash;"Dr. Thomas who squints."&mdash;"They both squint." They were
afterwards both Bishops.</p>

<h4>MCCXLIV.&mdash;FORTUNATE STARS.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">My</span> stars!" cried a courtier, with stars and lace twirled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What homage we nobles command in the world!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"True, my lord," said a wag, "though the world has its jars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Some people</i> owe much to their <i>fortunate stars</i>!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>MCCXLV.&mdash;A NEW READING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> the close of the administration of Sir Robert Walpole, he was
talking very freely to some of his friends of the vanity and vexations
of office, and, alluding to his intended retirement, quoted from Horace
the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lusisti satis, edisti satis, atque bibisti:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempus abire tibi est."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Pray, Sir Robert," said one of his friends, "is that good Latin?"&mdash;"I
think so," answered Sir. Robert; "what objection have you to
it?"&mdash;"Why," said the other dryly, "I did not know but the word might be
<i>bribe-isti</i> in your Horace."</p>

<h4>MCCXLVI.&mdash;QUITE AT EASE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Foote</span>, the actor, was one day taken into White's Club-House by a friend
who wanted to write a note. Lord Carmarthen approached to speak to him;
but feeling rather shy, he merely said, "Mr. Foote, your handkerchief is
hanging out of your pocket." Foote, looking suspiciously round, and
hurriedly thrusting the handkerchief back into his pocket, replied,
"Thank you, my lord: you know <i>the company</i> better than I do."</p>

<h4>MCCXLVII.&mdash;CHARLES, DUKE OF NORFOLK.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> cleanliness, the Duke was negligent to so great a degree,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> that he
rarely made use of water for purposes of bodily refreshment and comfort.
Nor did he change his linen more frequently than he washed himself.
Complaining, one day, to Dudley North, that he was a martyr to
rheumatism, and had ineffectually tried every remedy for its relief,
"Pray, my lord," said he, "did you ever <i>try a clean shirt</i>?"</p>

<h4>MCCXLVIII.&mdash;CLEARING EMIGRANTS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> Irish gentleman, resident in Canada, was desirous to persuade his
sons to work as backwoodsmen, instead of drinking champagne at something
more than a dollar a bottle. Whenever this old gentleman saw his sons so
engaged he used to exclaim, "Ah, my boys! there goes an acre of land,
<i>trees and all</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXLIX.&mdash;PARLIAMENTARY CASE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Andrews</span>, who was master and a great benefactor of Pembroke Hall,
was one day at court with Waller the poet, and others. While King James
was at dinner, attended by Andrews, Bishop of Winchester, and Neale,
Bishop of Durham, his Majesty said to the prelates: "My lords, cannot I
take my subjects' <i>money</i> when I want it, without all this formality in
Parliament?" Bishop Neale quickly replied, "God forbid, sir, but you
should: you are the breath of our nostrils." On which the king said to
the Bishop of Winchester, "Well, my lord, and what say you?"&mdash;"Sir,"
replied Andrews, "I have no skill to judge of Parliamentary
cases."&mdash;"Come, come," answered his Majesty, "no put-offs, my lord;
answer me presently."&mdash;"Then, sir," said Andrews, "I think it lawful for
you to take my <i>brother Neale's money</i>, for he offers it."</p>

<h4>MCCL.&mdash;OUTLINE OF AN AMBASSADOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Duke de Choiseul, who was a remarkably meagre-looking man, came
to London to negotiate a peace, Charles Townsend, being asked whether
the French government had sent the <i>preliminaries</i> of a treaty,
answered, "he did not know, but they had sent <i>the outline of an
ambassador</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<h4>MCCLI.&mdash;NATURE AND ART.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A worthy</span> English agriculturist visited the great dinner-table of the
Astor House Hotel, in New York, and took up the bill of fare. His eye
caught up the names of its&mdash;to him&mdash;unknown dishes: "Soupe &agrave; la
flamande"&mdash;"Soupe &agrave; la Creci"&mdash;"Langue de B&#339;uf piqu&eacute;e"&mdash;"Pieds de
Cochon &agrave; la Ste. M&eacute;n&eacute;hould"&mdash;"Pat&eacute;s de sanglier"&mdash;"Pat&eacute;s &agrave; la gel&eacute;e de
volailles"&mdash;"Les cannelons de cr&egrave;me glac&eacute;e." It was too much for his
simple heart. Laying down the scarlet-bound volume in disgust, he cried
to the waiter, "Here, my good man, I shall go back to <i>first
principles</i>! Give us some beans and bacon!"</p>

<h4>MCCLII.&mdash;A COMPARISON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is with narrow-souled people as with narrow-necked bottles,&mdash;the less
they have in them, the <i>more noise</i> they make in pouring it out.</p>

<h4>MCCLIII.&mdash;THE SNUFF-BOX.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a party in Portman Square, Brummell's snuff-box was particularly
admired: it was handed round, and a gentleman, finding it rather
difficult to open, incautiously applied a dessert-knife to the lid. Poor
Brummell was on thorns; at last he could not contain himself any longer,
and, addressing the host, said, with his characteristic quaintness,
"Will you be good enough to tell your friend that my snuff-box is <i>not
an oyster</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLIV.&mdash;NOT SICK ENOUGH FOR THAT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Plunket</span> is said to have acutely felt his forced resignation of the
Irish Chancellorship, and his <i>supersedeas</i> by Lord Campbell. A violent
tempest arose on the day of the latter's expected arrival, and a friend
remarking to Plunket how sick of his promotion the passage must have
made the new comer; "Yes," replied the ex-chancellor, ruefully, "but it
won't make him <i>throw up the seals</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLV.&mdash;A SEASONABLE JOKE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral Duncan's</span> address to the officers who came on board his ship for
instructions previous to the engagement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> with Admiral de Winter, was
both laconic and humorous: "Gentlemen, you see a severe <i>winter</i>
approaching; I have only to advise you to keep up a <i>good fire</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLVI.&mdash;GETTING A LIVING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Duke of Grafton, when hunting, was thrown into a ditch; at the
same time a young curate, calling out "Lie still, your Grace"; leaped
over him, and pursued his sport. On being assisted to remount by his
attendants, the duke said, "That young man shall have the first good
living that falls to my disposal; had he <i>stopped</i> to have taken care of
me, I never would have patronized him," being delighted with an ardor
similar to his own, or with a spirit that would <i>not stoop to flatter</i>.</p>

<h4>MCCLVII.&mdash;GOOD EYES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> of wit being asked what pleasure he could have in the company of a
pretty woman who was a loquacious simpleton, replied, "I love to <i>see</i>
her talk."</p>

<h4>MCCLVIII.&mdash;INDIFFERENCE TO LIFE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A soldier</span>, who was being led to the gallows, saw a crowd of people
running on before. "Don't be in such a hurry," said he to them. "I can
assure you nothing will be done <i>without me</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLIX.&mdash;A LAST RESOURCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Villiers</span>, Duke of Buckingham, was making his complaint to Sir John
Cutler, a rich miser, of the disorder of his affairs, and asked him what
he should do to avoid the ruin. "Live as I do, my lord," said Sir John.
"That I can do," answered the duke, "when <i>I am ruined</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLX.&mdash;A DULL MAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Byron</span> knew a dull man who lived on a <i>bon mot</i> of Moore's for a
week; and his lordship once offered a wager of a considerable sum that
the reciter was <i>guiltless</i> of understanding its point; but he could get
no one to accept the bet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<h4>MCCLXI.&mdash;WHITE TEETH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Saunderson</span>, who occupied so distinguished a situation in the
University of Cambridge as that of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics,
was <i>quite blind</i>. Happening to make one in a large party, he remarked
of a lady, who had just left the room, that she had very <i>white teeth</i>.
The company were anxious to learn how he had discovered this, which was
very true. "I have reason," observed the professor, "to believe that the
lady is not a <i>fool</i>, and I can think of no other motive for her
laughing incessantly, as she did for a whole hour together."</p>

<h4>MCCLXII.&mdash;A PLEASANT PARTNER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A farmer</span> having bought a barn in partnership with a neighbor who
neglected to make use of it, plentifully stored his own part with corn,
and expostulated with his partner on having laid out his money in so
useless a way, adding, "You had better do <i>something</i> with it, as you
see I have done."&mdash;"As to that, neighbor," replied the other, "every man
has a right to do what he will with his own, and <i>you</i> have done so; but
I have made up my mind about my part of the property,&mdash;I shall set it on
fire."</p>

<h4>MCCLXIII.&mdash;TWO CARRIAGES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> ladies disputed for precedency, one the daughter of a wealthy
brewer, the other the daughter of a gentleman of small fortune. "You are
to consider, miss," said the brewer's daughter, "that my papa keeps a
coach."&mdash;"Very true, miss," said the other, "and <i>you</i> are to consider
that he likewise keeps a <i>dray</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLXIV.&mdash;EXCUSABLE FEAR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A husband</span>, who only opposed his wife's ill humor by silence, was told by
a friend that he "was afraid of his wife."&mdash;"It is not <i>she</i> I am afraid
of," replied the husband, "it is <i>the noise</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLXV.&mdash;COLERIDGE AND THELWALL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Thelwall</span> and Coleridge were sitting once in a beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> recess in the
Quantock Hills, when the latter said, "Citizen John, this is a fine
place to <i>talk</i> treason in!"&mdash;"Nay, Citizen Samuel," replied he; "It is
rather a place to make a man <i>forget</i> that there is any necessity for
treason!"</p>

<h4>MCCLXVI.&mdash;A FLASH OF WIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney Smith</span>, after Macaulay's return from the East, remarked to a
friend who had been speaking of the distinguished conversationalist:
"Yes, he is certainly more agreeable since his return from India. His
enemies might perhaps have said before (though I never did so) that he
talked rather too much; but now he has <i>occasional flashes of silence,
that make his conversation perfectly delightful</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCCLXVII.&mdash;LOST AND FOUND.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ferryman, whilst plying over a water which was only slightly
agitated, was asked by a timid lady in his boat, whether any persons
were ever lost in that river. "O no," said he, "we always <i>finds 'em
agin</i> the next day."</p>

<h4>MCCLXVIII.&mdash;A MILITARY AXIOM.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old soldier having been brought up to vote at an election at the
expense of one of the candidates, voted for his opponent, and when
reproached for his conduct, replied, "Always <i>quarter</i> upon the enemy,
my lads; always <i>quarter</i> upon the enemy."</p>

<h4>MCCLXIX.&mdash;A FORCIBLE ARGUMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> erudite Cantab, Bishop Burnett, preaching before Charles II., being
much warmed with his subject, uttered some religious truth with great
vehemence, and at the same time, striking his fist on the desk with
great violence, cried out, "Who dare deny this?"&mdash;"Faith," said the
king, in a tone more <i>piano</i> than that of the orator, "nobody that is
within the reach of <i>that fist of yours</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLXX.&mdash;NOT TO BE DONE BROWN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thomas Brown</span> courted a lady for many years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> but unsuccessfully,
during which time it had been his custom to drink the lady's health
before that of any other; but being observed one evening to omit it, a
gentleman reminded him of it, and said, "Come, doctor, drink the lady,
your toast." The doctor replied, "I have toasted her many years, and I
cannot make her <i>Brown</i>, so I'll toast her no longer."</p>

<h4>MCCLXXI.&mdash;AN ODD NOTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> the other day meeting a girl who had lately left her service,

<h4>MCCLXXII.&mdash;A SURE TAKE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old sportsman, who, at the age of eighty-three, was met by a friend
riding very fast, and was asked what he was in pursuit of? "Why, sir,"
replied the other, "I am riding <i>after my eighty-fourth year</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLXXIII.&mdash;MR. TIERNEY'S HUMOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Tierney</span>, when alluding to the difficulty the Foxites and Pittites
had in passing over to join each other in attacking the Addington
Ministry (forgetting at the moment how easily he had himself overcome a
like difficulty in joining that Ministry), alluded to the puzzle of the
Fox and the Goose, and did not clearly expound his idea. Whereupon, Mr.
Dudley North said, "It's himself he means,&mdash;who left the <i>Fox</i> to go
over to the <i>Goose</i>, and put the bag of oats in his pocket."</p>

<h4>MCCLXXIV.&mdash;DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">If</span> I were so unlucky," said an officer, "as to have a stupid son, I
would certainly by all means make him a <i>parson</i>." A clergyman who was
in company calmly replied, "You think differently, sir, from <i>your
father</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLXXV.&mdash;ORTHOGRAPHY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> laird of M'N&mdash;&mdash;b was writing a letter from an Edinburgh
coffee-house, when a friend observed that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> was setting at defiance
the laws of orthography and grammar. "I ken that weel eno'!" exclaimed
the Highland chieftain, "but how can a man <i>write grammar</i> with a pen
like this?"</p>

<h4>MCCLXXVI.&mdash;A SHORT JOURNEY.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Zounds</span>, fellow!" exclaimed a choleric old gentleman to a very

you won't have <i>far to go</i>," said the phlegmatic man.</p>

<h4>MCCLXXVII.&mdash;LORD HOWE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral Lord Howe</span>, when a captain, was once hastily awakened in the
middle of the night by the lieutenant of the watch, who informed him
with great agitation that the ship was on fire near the magazine. "If
that be the case," said he, rising leisurely to put on his clothes, "we
shall soon know it." The lieutenant flew back to the scene of danger,
and almost instantly returning, exclaimed, "You need not, sir, be
afraid, the fire is extinguished."&mdash;"Afraid!" exclaimed Howe, "what do
you mean by that, sir? I never was afraid in my life"; and looking the
lieutenant full in the face, he added, "Pray, how does a man feel, sir,
when he is afraid? I need not ask how <i>he looks</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLXXVIII.&mdash;RATHER ETHEREAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. John Wilkins</span> wrote a work in the reign of Charles II., to show the

who was likewise notorious for her vagrant speculations, said to him,
"Doctor, where am I to bait at in the <i>upward</i> journey?"&mdash;"My lady,"
replied the doctor, "of all the people in the world, I never expected

<h4>MCCLXXIX.&mdash;HENRY VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> monarch, after the death of Jane Seymour, had some difficulty to
get another wife. His first offer was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> the Duchess Dowager of Milan;
but her answer was, "She had but <i>one</i> head; if she had <i>two</i>, one
should have been at his service."</p>

<h4>MCCLXXX.&mdash;MELODRAMATIC HIT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Burke's</span> was a complete failure, when he flung the dagger on the floor of
the House of Commons, and produced nothing but a smothered laugh, and a
joke from Sheridan.&mdash;"The gentleman has brought us the <i>knife</i>, but
where is the <i>fork</i>?"</p>

<h4>MCCLXXXI.&mdash;A LONG ILLNESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A clergyman</span> in the country taking his text from the fourteenth verse of
the third chapter of St. Matthew: "And Peter's wife's mother lay sick of
a fever," preached three Sundays on the same subject. Soon after, two
country fellows going across a churchyard, and hearing the bell toll,
one asked the other who it was for? "I can't exactly tell," replied he;
"but it may be for Peter's wife's mother, for she has been sick of a
fever <i>these three weeks</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLXXXII.&mdash;DIALOGUE IN THE WESTERN ISLANDS OF SCOTLAND.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> long is this loch?"</p>

<p>"It will be about twanty mile."</p>

<p>"Twenty miles! surely it cannot be so much?"</p>

<p>"Maybe it will be twelve."</p>

<p>"It does not really seem more than four."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I'm thinking you're right."</p>

<p>"Really, you seem to know nothing about the matter."</p>

<p>"Troth, I <i>canna say I do</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLXXXIII.&mdash;WHAT'S IN A NAME?</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after Lord &mdash;&mdash;'s elevation to the peerage, he remarked that authors
were often very ridiculous in the <i>titles</i> they gave. "That," said a
distinguished writer present, "is an error from which even sovereigns
appear <i>not to be exempt</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<h4>MCCLXXXIV.&mdash;TILLOTSON.</h4>

the shortness of his sermon, answered, "Sire, could I have bestowed more
time upon it, it would not have been <i>so long</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCCLXXXV.&mdash;IMPORTANT TO BACHELORS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> clever fellow has invented a new kind of ink, called "the
love-letter ink." It is a sure preventive against all cases of "breach
of promise," as the ink <i>fades away</i>, and leaves the sheet blank, in
about four weeks after being written upon.</p>

<h4>MCCLXXXVI.&mdash;CHIN-SURVEYING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> not far from Torrington, Devon, whose face is somewhat above
the ordinary dimensions, has been waited on and shaved by a certain
barber every day for twenty-one years, without coming to any regular
settlement; the tradesman, thinking it time to wind up the account,
carried in his bill, charging one penny per day, which amounted to
31l. 9s. 2d. The gentleman, thinking this rather exorbitant, made
some scruple about payment, when the tonsor proposed, if his customer
thought proper, to charge by the acre, at the rate of 200l. This was
readily agreed to, and on measuring the premises, 192 square inches
proved to be the contents, which, traversed over 7670 times, would
measure 1,472,640 inches, the charge for which would be 46l. 19s.
1d.&mdash;being 15l. 9s. 11d. in favor of <i>chin-surveying</i>.</p>

<h4>MCCLXXXVII.&mdash;CHANGING HATS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Barry</span> the painter was with Nollekens at Rome in 1760, and they were
extremely intimate. Barry took the liberty one night, when they were
about to leave the English coffee-house, to exchange hats with him.
Barry's was edged with lace, and Nollekens's was a very shabby, plain
one. Upon his returning the hat the next morning, he was asked by
Nollekens why he left him his gold-laced hat. "Why, to tell you the
truth, my dear Joey," answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> Barry, "I fully expected assassination
last night; and I was to have been known by <i>my laced hat</i>." Nollekens
used to relate the story, adding, "It's what the Old-Bailey people would
call a true bill against Jem."</p>

<h4>MCCLXXXVIII.&mdash;POWDER WITHOUT BALL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Goodall</span>, of Eton, about the same time that he was made Provost of
Eton, received also a Stall at Windsor. A young lady, whilst
congratulating him on his elevation, and requesting him to give a ball
during the vacation, happened to touch his wig with her fan, and caused
the powder to fly about; upon which the doctor exclaimed, "My dear, you
see you can get the powder out of the <i>cannon</i>, but not the <i>ball</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCLXXXIX.&mdash;POPE'S LAST ILLNESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> Pope's last illness, a squabble happened in his chamber, between
his two physicians, Dr. Burton and Dr. Thomson, they mutually charging
each other with hastening the death of the patient by improper
prescriptions. Pope at length silenced them by saying, "Gentlemen, I
only learn by your discourse that I am in a dangerous way; therefore,
all I now ask is, that the following epigram may be added after my death
to the next edition of the Dunciad, by way of postscript:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Dunces rejoice, forgive all censures past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>greatest dunce</i> has killed your foe at last.'"<br /></span>

<h4>MCCXC.&mdash;OPPOSITE TEMPERS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">General Sutton</span> was very passionate, and calling one morning on Sir
Robert Walpole, who was quite the reverse, found his servant shaving
him. During the conversation, Sir Robert said, "John, you cut me"; and
continued the former subject of discourse. Presently he said again,
"John, you cut me"; but as mildly as before: and soon after he had
occasion to say it a third time; when Sutton, starting up in a rage,
said, swearing a great oath, and doubling his fist at the servant, "If
Sir Robert can bear it, I cannot; and if you cut him once more, John,
<i>I'll knock you down</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<h4>MCCXCI.&mdash;A CONJUGAL CONCLUSION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A woman</span> having fallen into a river, her husband went to look for her,
proceeding up the stream from the place where she fell in. The
bystanders asked him if he was mad,&mdash;she could not have gone against the
stream. The man answered, "She was <i>obstinate</i> and <i>contrary</i> in her
life, and no doubt she was the <i>same at her death</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXCII.&mdash;A QUEER EXPRESSION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A poor</span> but clever student in the University of Glasgow was met by one of
the Professors, who noticing the scantiness of his academical toga,
said, "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, your gown is very short."&mdash;"It will be long enough,
sir, before I get another," replied the student. The answer tickled the
Professor greatly, and he went on quietly chuckling to himself, when he
met a brother Professor, who, noticing his hilarity, inquired what was
amusing him so much. "Why, that fellow &mdash;&mdash; said such a funny thing. I
asked why his gown was so short, and he said, 'it will be a long time
before I get another.'"&mdash;"There's nothing very funny in that."&mdash;"Well,
no," replied the other, "there is not, after all. But <i>it was the way he
said it</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCXCIII.&mdash;AN IRISHMAN'S NOTION OF DISCOUNT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> chanced, one gloomy day in the month of December, that a good-humored
Irishman applied to a merchant to discount a bill of exchange for him at
rather a long though not an unusual date; and the merchant having
casually remarked that the bill had a great many days to run, "That's
true," replied the Irishman, "but consider how <i>short the days are</i> at
this time of the year."</p>

<h4>MCCXCIV.&mdash;A PARTICIPATION IN A PRACTICAL JOKE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> unlucky lads in the University bearing a spite to the dean for his
severity towards them, went secretly one night and daubed the rails of
his staircase with tar. The dean coming down in the dark, dirtied his
hands and coat very much with the tar; and, being greatly enraged, he
sent for one most suspected to be the author. This the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> lad utterly
denied; but said, "Truly, I did it not; but if you please, I can tell
you who had <i>a hand in it</i>." Here they thought to have found out the
truth, and asked him who. The lad answered, "<i>Your worship, sir</i>"; which
caused him to be dismissed with great applause for his ingenuity.</p>

<h4>MCCXCV.&mdash;INGRATITUDE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lord B&mdash;&mdash; died, a person met an old man who was one of his most
intimate friends. He was pale, confused, awe-stricken. Every one was
trying to console him, but in vain. "His loss," he exclaimed, "does not
affect me so much as his horrible ingratitude. Would you believe it? he
died without leaving me anything in his will,&mdash;I, who have <i>dined with
him, at his own house, three times a week for thirty years</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCCXCVI.&mdash;A PREFIX.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lord Melcombe's name was plain Bubb, he was intended by the
administration to be sent ambassador to Spain. Lord Chesterfield met
him, and told him he was not a fit person to be representative of the
crown of England at the Spanish court, on account of the shortness of
his name, as the Spaniards pride themselves on the length of their
titles, "unless," added his lordship, "you don't mind calling yourself
<i>Silly-Bubb</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCCXCVII.&mdash;A GOOD MIXTURE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> eminent painter was once asked what he mixed his colors with in order
to produce so extraordinary an effect. "I mix them with <i>brains</i>, sir!"
was his answer.</p>

<h4>MCCXCVIII.&mdash;SIR WALTER SCOTT'S PARRITCH-PAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the museum at Abbotsford there is a small Roman <i>patera</i>, or goblet,
in showing which Sir Walter Scott tells the following story: "I
purchased this" (says he) "at a nobleman's roup near by, at the enormous
sum of twenty-five guineas. I would have got it for twenty-pence if an
antiquary who knew its value had not been there and opposed me. However,
I was almost consoled for the bitter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> price it cost by the amusement I
derived from an old woman, who had evidently come from a distance to
purchase some trifling culinary articles, and who had no taste for the
antique. At every successive guinea which we bade for the <i>patera</i> this
good old lady's mouth grew wider and wider with unsophisticated
astonishment, until at last I heard her mutter to herself, in a tone
which I shall never forget,&mdash;'Five-an-twenty guineas! <i>If the
parritch-pan gangs at that, what will the kail-pan gang for</i>!'"</p>

<h4>MCCXCIX.&mdash;HORNE TOOKE AND WILKES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Horne Tooke</span> having challenged Wilkes, who was then Sheriff of London and
Middlesex, received the following laconic reply: "Sir, I do not think it
my business to cut the throat of every desperado that may be tired of
his life; but, as I am at present High Sheriff of the city of London, it
may happen that I shall shortly have an opportunity of attending you in
my official capacity, in which case I will answer for it that <i>you shall
have no ground</i> to complain of my endeavors to serve you."</p>

<h4>MCCC.&mdash;A LITERARY RENDERING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Scotch</span> lady gave her servant very particular instructions regarding
visitors, explaining, that they were to be shown into the drawing-room,
and no doubt used the Scotticism, "<i>Carry</i> any ladies that call up
stairs." On the arrival of the first visitors, Donald was eager to show
his strict attention to the mistress's orders. Two ladies came together,
and Donald, seizing one in his arms, said to the other, "Bide ye there
till <i>I come for ye</i>," and, in spite of her struggles and remonstrances,
ushered the terrified visitor into his mistress's presence in this
unwonted fashion.</p>

<h4>MCCCI.&mdash;TEMPERANCE CRUETS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late James Smith might often be seen at the Garrick Club,
restricting himself at dinner to a half-pint of sherry; whence he was
designated an incorporated temperance society. The late Sir William
Aylett, a grumbling member of the Union, and a two-bottle-man,
observing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> Mr. Smith to be thus frugally furnished, eyed his cruet with
contempt, and exclaimed: "So I see you have got one of those
<i>life-preservers</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCCCII.&mdash;DR GLYNN'S RECEIPT FOR DRESSING A CUCUMBER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Glynn</span>, whose name is still remembered in Cambridge, being one day in
attendance on a lady, in the quality of her physician, took the liberty
of lecturing her on the impropriety of eating <i>cucumber</i>, of which she
was immoderately fond, and gave her the following humorous receipt for
dressing them: "Peel the cucumber," said the doctor, "with great care;
then cut it into very thin slices, pepper and salt it well, and
then&mdash;<i>throw it away</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCCIII.&mdash;"WHAT'S A HAT WITHOUT A HEAD?"</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Innes</span> of the Guards (usually called Jock Innes by his
contemporaries) was with others getting ready for Flushing, or some of
those expeditions at the beginning of the great war. His commanding
officer remonstrated about the badness of his hat, and recommended a new
one. "Na! na! bide a wee," said Jock; "whare we're ga'in', faith
there'll soon be mair <i>hats</i> nor <i>heads</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCCIV.&mdash;SEVERE REBUKE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir William B.</span> being at a parish meeting, made some proposals which were
objected to by a farmer. Highly enraged, "Sir," said he to the farmer,
"do you know that I have been at two universities, and at two colleges
in each university?"&mdash;"Well, sir," replied the farmer, "what of that? I
had a calf that sucked two cows, and the observation I made was, the
<i>more he sucked</i> the <i>greater calf</i> he grew."</p>

<h4>MCCCV.&mdash;HORSES TO GRASS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> an Irish paper was an advertisement for horses to stand at livery, on
the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-tailed horses, at 3s. 6d. per week.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-tailed horses at 3s. per week.<br />
</p>

<p>On inquiry into the cause of the difference, it was answered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> that the
horses with long tails could brush the flies off their backs while
eating, whereas the short-tailed horses were obliged to take their heads
<i>from the manger</i>.</p>

<h4>MCCCVI.&mdash;INADVERTENCE AND EPICURISM.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Duke of Wellington was at Paris, as Commander of the Allied
Armies, he was invited to dine with Cambac&egrave;res, one of the most
distinguished statesmen and <i>gourmets</i> of the time of Napoleon. In the
course of dinner, his host having helped him to some particularly
<i>recherch&eacute;</i> dish, expressed a hope that he found it agreeable. "Very
good," said the Duke, who was probably reflecting on Waterloo; "very
good, but I really do not care what I eat."&mdash;"Don't care what you eat!"
exclaimed Cambac&egrave;res, as he started back, and dropped his fork; "what
<i>did</i> you come here for, then!"</p>

<h4>MCCCVII.&mdash;VERY TRUE.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">All</span> that is necessary for the enjoyment of sausages at breakfast is
<i>confidence</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCCVIII.&mdash;A JEW'S EYE TO BUSINESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Jew</span>, who was condemned to be hanged, was brought to the gallows, and
was just on the point of being turned off, when a reprieve arrived. When
informed of this, it was expected he would instantly have quitted the
cart, but he stayed to see a fellow-prisoner hanged; and being asked why
he did not get about his business, he said, "he waited to see if he
could bargain with Mr. Ketch for the <i>other</i> gentleman's clothes."</p>

<h4>MCCCIX.&mdash;ST. PETER A BACHELOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the list of benefactors to Peter-House is Lady Mary Ramsay, who is
reported to have offered a very large property, nearly equal to a new
foundation to this college, on condition that the name should be changed
to <i>Peter and Mary's</i>; but she was thwarted in her intention by Dr.
Soame, then master. "Peter," said the crabbed humorist, "has been too
long a <i>bachelor</i> to think of a female companion in his old days."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<h4>MCCCX.&mdash;TRUE OF BOTH.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I swear</span>," said a gentleman to his mistress, "you are very
handsome."&mdash;"Pooh!" said the lady, "so you would say if you did not
think so."&mdash;"And so you would <i>think</i>," answered he, "though I should
not <i>say so</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCCXI.&mdash;A POSER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lecturer</span>, wishing to explain to a little girl the manner in which a
lobster casts his shell when he has outgrown it, said, "What do you do
when you have outgrown your clothes? You throw them aside, don't
you?"&mdash;"O no!" replied the little one, "<i>we let out the tucks</i>!" The
doctor confessed she had the advantage of him there.</p>

<h4>MCCCXII.&mdash;VERY APPROPRIATE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A facetious</span> old gentleman, who thought his two sons consumed too much
time in hunting and shooting, styled them <i>Nimrod</i> and <i>Ramrod</i>.</p>

<h4>MCCCXIII.&mdash;A BAD JUDGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the occasion of the birth of the Princess Royal, the Duke of
Wellington was in the act of leaving Buckingham Palace, when he met Lord
Hill; in answer to whose inquiries about Her Majesty and the little
stranger, his grace replied, "Very fine child, and very red, very red;
nearly as red as you, <i>Hill</i>!" a jocose allusion to Lord Hill's claret
complexion.</p>

<h4>MCCCXIV.&mdash;WHITE HANDS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a country market a lady, laying her hand upon a joint of veal, said,
"Mr. Smallbone, I think this veal is not quite so white as
usual."&mdash;"<i>Put on your gloves</i>, madam," replied the butcher, "and you
will think differently." The lady did so, and the veal was ordered home
immediately.</p>

<h4>MCCCXV.&mdash;TRUE TO THE LETTER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may be all very well to say that the office of a tax-gatherer needs
no great ability for the fulfilment of its duties,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> but there is no
employment which requires such constant <i>application</i>.</p>

<h4>MCCCXVI.&mdash;SIR WALTER SCOTT AND CONSTABLE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Scott</span> is known to have profited much by Constable's bibliographical
knowledge, which was very extensive. The latter christened "Kenilworth,"
which Scott named "Cumnor Hall." John Ballantyne objected to the former
title, and told Constable the result would be "something worthy of the
kennel"; but the result proved the reverse. Mr. Cadell relates that
Constable's vanity boiled over so much at this time, on having his
suggestions gone into, that, in his high moods, he used to stalk up and
down his room, and exclaim, "By Jove, I am <i>all but</i> the author of the
Waverley Novels!"</p>

<h4>MCCCXVII.&mdash;TRUE PHILOSOPHY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Le Sage</span>, the author of Gil Blas, said, to console himself for his
deafness, with his usual humor, "When I go into a company where I find a
great number of blockheads and babblers, I replace my trumpet in my
pocket, and cry, 'Now, gentlemen, <i>I defy</i> you all.'"</p>

<h4>MCCCXVIII.&mdash;ANSWERED AT ONCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Scotch</span> clergyman preaching a drowsy sermon, asked, "What is <i>the
price</i> of earthly pleasure?" The deacon, a fat grocer, woke up hastily
from a sound sleep, and cried out, lustily, "Seven-and-sixpence a
dozen!"</p>

<h4>MCCCXIX.&mdash;A DEADLY WEAPON.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, sir," asked a noisy disputant, "don't you think that I have
<i>mauled</i> my antagonist to some purpose?"&mdash;"O yes," replied a listener,
"you have,&mdash;and if ever I should happen to fight with the Philistines,
I'll borrow <i>your jaw-bone</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCCCXX.&mdash;EQUALITY OF THE LAW.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following cannot be omitted from a <i>Jest Book</i>, although somewhat
lengthy:&mdash;</p>

<p>A man was convicted of bigamy, and the annexed conversation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> took
place.&mdash;Clerk of Assize: "What have you to say why judgment should not
be passed upon you according to law?" Prisoner: "Well, my Lord, my wife
took up with a hawker, and run away five years ago, and I've never seen
her since, and I married this other woman last winter." Mr. Justice
Maule: "I will tell you what you ought to have done; and if you say you
did not know, I must tell you the law conclusively presumes that you
did. You ought to have instructed your attorney to bring an action
against the hawker for criminal conversation with your wife. That would
have cost you about &pound;100. When you had recovered substantial damages
against the hawker, you would have instructed your proctor to sue in the
Ecclesiastical Courts for a divorce <i>&agrave; mensa atque thoro</i>. That would
have cost you &pound;200 or &pound;300 more. When you had obtained a divorce <i>&agrave;
mensa atque thoro</i>, you would have had to appear by counsel before the
House of Lords for a divorce <i>&agrave; vinculo matrimonii</i>. The bill might have
been opposed in all its stages in both Houses of Parliament; and
altogether you would have had to spend about &pound;1000 or &pound;1200. You will
probably tell me that you never had a thousand farthings of your own in
the world; but, prisoner, that makes no difference. Sitting here as a
British judge, it is my duty to tell you that <i>this is not a country in
which there is one law for the rich and another for the poor</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCCXXI.&mdash;OPEN CONFESSION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a cause tried in the Court of Queen's Bench, the plaintiff being a
widow, and the defendants two medical men who had treated her for
<i>delirium tremens</i>, and put her under restraint as a lunatic, witnesses
were called on the part of the plaintiff to prove that she was not
addicted to drinking. The last witness called by Mr. Montagu Chambers,
the leading counsel on the part of the plaintiff, was Dr. Tunstal, who
closed his evidence by describing a case of <i>delirium tremens</i> treated
by him, in which the patient <i>recovered in a single night</i>. "It was,"
said the witness, "a case of gradual drinking, <i>sipping all day</i>, from
morning till night." These words were scarcely uttered, than Mr.
Chambers, turning to the Bench, said, "My lord, <i>that is my case</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<h4>MCCCXXII.&mdash;QUITE PROFESSIONAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A comedian</span>, who had been almost lifted from his feet by the pressure at
the funeral of a celebrated tragedian, ultimately reached the
church-door. Having recovered his breath, which had been suspended in
the effort, he exclaimed, "And so this is the last we shall ever see of
him. Poor fellow! he has <i>drawn a full house</i>, though, to the end."</p>

<h4>MCCCXXIII.&mdash;ON DR. LETTSOM.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">If</span> anybody comes to I,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I physics, bleeds, and sweats 'em;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If after that they like to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why, what care I, I Lettsom.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>MCCCXXIV.&mdash;EQUITABLE LAW.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A rich</span> man made his will, leaving all he had to a company of
fellow-citizens to dispose of, but reserving to his right heir "such a
portion as pleased them." The heir having sued the company for his share
of the property, the judge inquired whether they wished to carry out the
will of the testator, and if so, what provision they proposed making for
the heir? "He shall have a tenth part," said they, "and we will retain
for ourselves the other nine."&mdash;"Take, then," said the judge, "the tenth
part to yourselves, and leave the rest to the heir; for by the will he
is to have what part '<i>pleaseth you</i>.'"</p>

<h4>MCCCXXV.&mdash;IRISH AND SCOTCH LOYALTY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> George the Fourth went to Ireland, one of the "pisintry" said to
the toll-keeper as the king passed through, "Och, now! an' his majesty
never paid the turnpike, an' how's that?"&mdash;"O, kings never does; we lets
'em go free," was the answer. "Then there's the dirty money for ye,"
says Pat; "It shall never be said that the king came here, and found
nobody to <i>pay the turnpike for him</i>." Tom Moore told this story to Sir
Walter Scott, when they were comparing notes as to the two royal visits.
"Now, Moore," replied Scott, "there ye have just the advantage of us:
there was no want of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> enthusiasm here; the Scotch folk would have done
anything in the world for his majesty, except <i>pay the turnpike</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCCXXVI.&mdash;RUNNING ACCOUNTS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> valet of a man of fashion could get no money from him, and therefore
told him that he should seek another master, and begged he would pay him
the arrears of his wages. The gentleman, who liked his servant, and was
desirous of keeping him, said, "True, I am in your debt, but your wages
are <i>running on</i>."&mdash;"That's the very thing," answered the valet; "I am
afraid they are <i>running</i> so fast, that I shall never <i>catch</i> them."</p>

<h4>MCCCXXVII.&mdash;ON BLOOMFIELD, THE POET.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Bloomfield</span>, thy happy-omened name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ensures continuance to thy fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both sense and truth this verdict give.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While <i>fields</i> shall <i>bloom</i>, thy name shall live!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>MCCCXXVIII.&mdash;SCOTCHMAN AND HIGHWAYMEN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Scotch</span> pedestrian, attacked by three highwaymen, defended himself with
great courage, but was at last overpowered, and his pockets rifled. The
robbers expected, from the extraordinary resistance they had
experienced, to find a rich booty; but were surprised to discover that
the whole treasure which the sturdy Caledonian had been defending at the
hazard of his life, was only a crooked sixpence. "The deuse is in him,"
said one of the rogues: "if he had had <i>eighteen-pence</i> I suppose he
would have <i>killed</i> the whole of us."</p>

<h4>MCCCXXIX.&mdash;IRISH IMPRUDENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1797, when democratic notions ran high, the king's coach was
attacked as his majesty was going to the House of Peers. A gigantic
Hibernian, who was conspicuously loyal in repelling the mob, attracted
the attention of the king. Not long after, the Irishman received a
message from Mr. Dundas to attend at his office. He went, and met with a
gracious reception from the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> man, who praised his loyalty and
courage, and desired him to point out any way in which he would wish to
be advanced, his majesty being desirous to reward him. Pat hesitated a
moment, and then smirkingly said, "I'll tell you what, mister, make a
<i>Scotchman</i> of me, and, by St. Patrick, there'll be no fear of my
gettin' on." The minister, dumfounded for the moment by the
<i>mal-apropos</i> hit, replied, "Make a <i>Scotchman</i> of <i>you</i>, sir! that's
impossible, for I can't give you <i>prudence</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCCXXX.&mdash;THE PIGS AND THE SILVER SPOON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Earl of P&mdash;&mdash; kept a number of swine at his seat in Wiltshire, and
crossing the yard one day he was surprised to see the pigs gathered
round one trough, and making a great noise. Curiosity prompted him to
see what was the cause, and on looking into the trough he perceived a
large silver spoon. A servant-maid came out, and began to abuse the pigs
for crying so. "Well they may," said his lordship, "when they have got
but one <i>silver spoon</i> among them all."</p>

<h4>MCCCXXXI.&mdash;A FALSE FACE TRUE.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">That</span> there is <i>falsehood</i> in his looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must and will deny;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They say their master is a knave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sure <i>they do not lie</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>MCCCXXXII.&mdash;A CONSIDERATE MAYOR.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A country</span> mayor being newly got into office, that he might be seen to do
something in it, would persuade his brethren to have a new pair of
gallows built; but one of the aldermen said, that they had an old pair
which would serve well enough. "Yea," said the mayor, "the old ones
shall be to hang strangers on, and the new pair for <i>us and our heirs</i>
for ever."</p>

<h4>MCCCXXXIII.&mdash;THE SAFE SIDE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the riots of 1780, most persons in London, in order to save their
houses from being burnt or pulled down, wrote on their doors, "<i>No
Popery</i>!" Old Grimaldi,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> the father of the celebrated "Joey," to avoid
all mistakes, wrote on his, "<i>No Religion</i>!"</p>

<h4>MCCCXXXIV.&mdash;VISIBLY LOSING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> an election for the borough of Tallagh, Councillor Egan, or "bully
Egan," as he was familiarly called, being an unsuccessful candidate,
appealed to a Committee of the House of Commons. It was in the heat of a
very warm summer, and Egan (who was an immensely stout man) was
struggling through the crowd, his handkerchief in one hand, his wig in
the other, and his whole countenance raging like the dog-star, when he
met Curran. "I'm sorry for you, my dear fellow," said Curran. "Sorry!
why so, Jack, why so? I'm perfectly at my ease."&mdash;"Alas! Egan, it is but
too visible that you're losing <i>tallow</i> (Tallagh) fast!"</p>

<h4>MCCCXXXV.&mdash;REASON FOR THICK ANKLES.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">Harry</span>, I cannot think," says Dick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What makes my ankles grow so thick."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"<i>How great a calf</i> they have to carry."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>MCCCXXXVI.&mdash;ERASMUS VERSUS LUTHER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Erasmus</span>, of whom Cambridge has a right to be not a little proud, was
entreated by Lord Mountjoy to attack the <i>errors</i> of Luther. "My lord,"
answered Erasmus, "nothing is more easy than to say Luther is mistaken,
and nothing more difficult than to <i>prove</i> him so."</p>

<h4>MCCCXXXVII.&mdash;SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheridan</span> was once talking to a friend about the Prince Regent, who took
great credit to himself for various public measures, as if they had been
directed by his political skill, or foreseen by his political sagacity.
"<i>But</i>," said Sheridan, "<i>what his Royal Highness more particularly
prides himself in, is the late excellent harvest</i>."</p>

<h4>MCCCXXXVIII.&mdash;FAIRLY WON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> only practical joke in which Richard Harris Barham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> (better known by
his <i>nom-de-plume</i> of Thomas Ingoldsby) ever personally engaged, was
enacted when he was a boy at Canterbury. In company with a schoolfellow,
D&mdash;&mdash;, now a gallant major, he entered a Quakers' meeting-house; when,
looking round at the grave assembly, the latter held up a penny tart,
and said solemnly, "Whoever speaks first shall have this pie."&mdash;"Go thy
way, boy," said a drab-colored gentleman, rising; "go thy way,
and&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"The pie's <i>yours</i>, sir!" exclaimed D&mdash;&mdash;, placing it before
the astonished speaker, and hastily effecting his escape.</p>

<h4>MCCCXXXIX.&mdash;A FORTUNATE EXPEDIENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> of Trinity College, travelling through France, was annoyed
at the slowness of the pace, and wishing to urge the postilion to
greater speed, tried his bad French until he was out of patience. At
last it occurred to him that, if he was not understood, he might at
least frighten the fellow by using some high-sounding words, and he
roared into the ear of the postilion: "<i>Westmoreland, Cumberland,
Northumberland, Durham</i>!" which the fellow mistaking for some tremendous
threat, had the desired effect, and induced him to increase his speed.</p>

<h4>MCCCXL.&mdash;ON THE FOUR GEORGES.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">George</span> the First was always reckoned<br /></span>

<h4>MCCCXLI.&mdash;WHAT EVERYBODY DOES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Hopkins</span> once lent Simpson, his next door neighbor, an umbrella, and
having an urgent call to make on a wet day, knocked at Simpson's door.
"I want my umbrella."&mdash;"Can't have it," said Simpson. "Why? I want to go
to the East End, and it rains in torrents; what am I to do for an
umbrella?"&mdash;"Do?" answered Simpson, passing through the door, "do as <i>I</i>
did, <i>borrow one</i>!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<h4>MCCCXLII.&mdash;WHAT IS AN ARCHDEACON?</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Althorp</span>, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, having to propose to the
House of Commons a vote of &pound;400 a year for the salary of the Archdeacon
of Bengal, was puzzled by a question from Mr. Hume, "What are the duties
of an archdeacon?" So he sent one of the subordinate occupants of the
Treasury Bench to the other House to obtain an answer to the question
from one of the bishops. To Dr. Blomfield accordingly the messenger
went, and repeated the question, "What is an archdeacon?"&mdash;"An
archdeacon," replied the bishop, in his quick way, "an archdeacon is an
ecclesiastical officer, who performs archidiaconal functions"; and with
this reply Lord Althorp and the House were perfectly satisfied. It ought
to be added, however, that when the story was repeated to the bishop
himself, he said that he had no recollection of having made any such
answer; but that if he had, it must have been suggested to him by a
saying of old John White, a dentist, whom he had known in early days,
who used to recommend the use of lavender-water to his patients, and

<h4>MCCCXLVI.&mdash;A NEW IDEA.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of Mrs. Montague's blue-stocking ladies fastened upon Foote, at one
of the routs in Portman Square, with her views of Locke "On the
Understanding," which she protested she admired above all things; only
there was one particular word, very often repeated, which she could not
distinctly make out, and that was the word (pronouncing it very long)
<i>ide-a</i>. "But I suppose," said she, "it comes from a Greek

were extremely intimate. Kneller had a very fine garden, and as the
doctor was fond of flowers, he permitted him to have a door into it.
Ratcliffe's servants gathering and destroying the flowers, Kneller sent

rough manner, replied, "Tell him, he may do anything but <i>paint</i>
it."&mdash;"Well," replied Kneller, "he may say what he will, for tell him, I
will <i>take anything from him, except physic</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Douglas</span>, son of the Bishop of Salisbury, was six feet two inches in
height, and of enormous bulk. The little boys of Oxford always gathered
about him when he went into the streets, to look up at his towering
bulk. "Get out of my way, you little scamps," he used to cry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> "<i>or I

to preserve it for interment, in England. A sailor on board the ship
being frequently drunk, the captain forbade the purser, and indeed all
in the ship, to let him have any liquor. Shortly after the fellow
appeared very drunk. How he obtained the liquor, no one could guess. The

<h4>MCCCLV.&mdash;AWKWARD ORTHOGRAPHY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mathews</span> once went to Wakefield, then, from commercial failures, in a
dreadful state. In vain did he announce his inimitable "Youthful Days";
the Yorkshiremen came not. When he progressed to Edinburgh, a friend
asked him if he made much money in Wakefield. "Not a shilling!" was the
reply. "Not a shilling!" reiterated his astonished acquaintance. "Why,

mournfulness; "but they spell it with a <i>ve</i> in Wakefield."</p>

whereupon a young gentleman, a perfect stranger to the speaker, very
modestly said, "O then, you can take me with you; I want very much to
know her, and you can introduce me." While the other was standing aghast
at the impudence of the proposal, and muttering something about being
but a slight acquaintance himself, etc., Sydney Smith observed, "Pray

was organized. Meeting with Curran, Macnally said, "My dear friend,
these are not times for a man to be idle; I am determined to enter the
lawyers' corps, and follow the camp."&mdash;"You follow the camp, my little
limb of the law!" said the wit; "tut, tut, renounce the idea; you never

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wesley</span>, during his voyage to America, hearing an unusual noise in
the cabin of General Oglethorpe (the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> Governor of Georgia, with whom he
sailed), stepped in to inquire the cause of it, on which the General
immediately addressed him: "Mr. Wesley, you must excuse me. I have met
with a provocation too great for man to bear. You know the only wine I
drink is Cyprus wine, as it agrees with me the best of any; and this
villain Grimaldi (his foreign servant) has drunk up the whole I had on
board. But I will be revenged of him. I have ordered him to be tied hand
and foot, and to be carried to the man-of-war that sails with us. The
rascal should have taken care how he used me, for <i>I never
forgive</i>."&mdash;"Then I hope, sir," said John Wesley, looking calmly at him,
"<i>you never sin</i>." The General was quite confounded at the reproof, and
putting his hand into his pocket took out a bunch of keys, which he
threw at Grimaldi, saying, "There, villain! Take my keys, and behave
better for the future."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> young clergyman, modest almost to bashfulness, was once asked
by a country apothecary, of a contrary character, in a public and
crowded assembly, and in a tone of voice sufficient to catch the
attention of the whole company, "How it happened that the patriarchs
lived to such extreme old age?" To which question the clergyman replied,
"<i>Perhaps they took no physic</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> conceited young wits, as they thought themselves, passing along

"Good-morrow, father Isaac," said the next; "Good-morrow, father Jacob,"
cried the last. "I am neither Abraham, Isaac, nor Jacob," replied the
old gentleman, "but Saul, the son of Kish, who went out to seek his
father's <i>asses</i>, and lo! here I have found them."</p>

lungs; whereupon the advocate said, "Does not your lordship hear a
remarkable <i>echo in the court</i>?"</p>

<h4>MCDX.&mdash;A DUTIFUL DAUGHTER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> father of Mrs. Siddons had always forbidden her to marry an actor,
and of course she chose a member of the old gentleman's company, whom
she secretly wedded. When Roger Kemble heard of it he was furious. "Have
I not," he exclaimed, "dared you to marry a player?" The lady replied,
with downcast eyes, that she had not disobeyed. "What, madam! have you
not allied yourself to about the worst performer in my
company?"&mdash;"Exactly so," murmured the timid bride; "nobody can call

his wont) upon all his acquaintances in town. Meeting Curran afterwards

<h4>MCDL.&mdash;SCOTCH "WUT."</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> requires (says Sydney Smith) a surgical operation to get a joke well
into a Scotch understanding. Their only idea of wit, or rather that
inferior variety of the electric talent which prevails occasionally in
the North, and which, under the name of <i>Wut</i>, is so infinitely
distressing to people of good taste, is laughing immoderately at stated
intervals. They are so imbued with metaphysics that they even make love
metaphysically. I overheard a young lady of my acquaintance, at a dance
in Edinburgh, exclaim, in a sudden pause of the music, "What you say, my

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Earl of Lonsdale was so extensive a proprietor, and patron of
boroughs, that he returned nine members to Parliament, who were
facetiously called Lord Lonsdale's ninepins. One of the members thus
designated, having made a very extravagant speech in the House of
Commons, was answered by Mr. Burke in a vein of the happiest sarcasm,
which elicited from the House loud and continued cheers. Mr. Fox,
entering the House just as Mr. Burke was sitting down, inquired of
Sheridan what the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> House was cheering. "O, nothing of consequence,"

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening, at a private party at Oxford, at which Dr. Johnson was

referred to, and a gentleman, disposed to support the author's opinion
that the lower animals have an "immortal part," familiarly remarked to
the doctor, "Really, sir, when we see a very sensible dog, we don't know
what to think of him." Johnson, turning quickly round, replied, "True,

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Godfrey Kneller</span> latterly painted more for profit than for praise,

replied the artist: "why, they'll say Sir Godfrey Kneller <i>never</i>
painted them!"</p>

<h4>MCDLXIV.&mdash;AN ENTERTAINING PROPOSITION.</h4>

<h4>MCDLXIX.&mdash;ABSURDLY LOGICAL.</h4>

'tis, Quin, my boy, that a clever fellow like you should <i>be a player</i>!"

the care he lavished upon his person. Complaining, on a certain
occasion, to the late Chief-Justice Bushe, of Ireland, of the sufferings
he endured from rheumatism, that learned and humorous judge undertook to
prescribe a remedy. "You must desire your servant," he said to the
general, "to place every morning by your bedside a tub three-parts
filled with warm water. You will then get into the tub, and having
previously provided yourself with a pound of yellow soap, you must rub
your whole body with it, immersing yourself occasionally in the water,
and at the end of a quarter of an hour, the process concludes by wiping
yourself dry with towels, and scrubbing your person with a
flesh-brush."&mdash;"Why," said the general, after reflecting for a minute or

self."&mdash;"Well, I must confess," rejoined the judge, "<i>it is open to that
objection</i>."</p>

not <i>swallow John</i>! There are, however, <i>stomach-pumps</i> in case of
accident."</p>

<h4>MDXXIV.&mdash;A LATE DISCOVERER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> dull man, after dinner, had been boring the company with a long
discourse, in the course of which he had given utterance to ethical

<h4>MDXXVIII.&mdash;WONDERFUL UNANIMITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Clayton</span> was an honest man, but not a profound lawyer. Soon after
he was raised to the Irish bench, he happened to dine in company with
Counsellor Harwood, celebrated for his fine brogue, his humor, and his
legal knowledge. Clayton began to make some observations on the Laws of
Ireland. "In my country" (England), said he, "the laws are numerous, but
then one is always found to be a key to the other. In Ireland it is just
the contrary; your laws so perpetually clash with one another, and are
so very contradictory, that I protest <i>I don't understand

sport. "I say, young man," cried the rustic, "did you see a <i>tailor</i> on
the road?"&mdash;"Yes, I did; and he told me that, if I went a little

in the country. "Why, do you <i>bury</i> your attorneys here?" asked Foote.
"Yes, to be sure we do: how else?"&mdash;"O, we never do that in
London."&mdash;"No?" said the other, much surprised; "how do you manage,
then?"&mdash;"Why, when the patient happens to die, we lay him out in a room
over night by himself, lock the door, throw open the window, and in the
morning he is gone."&mdash;"Indeed!" exclaimed the farmer, with amazement;
"what becomes of him?"&mdash;"Why, that we cannot exactly tell; all we know

occasion to call the attention of the Essex incumbents to the necessity
of residing in their parishes; and he reminded them that curates were,
after all, of the same flesh and blood as rectors, and that the
residence which was possible for the one, could not be quite impossible
for the other. "Besides," added he, "there are two well-known
preservatives against ague; the one is, a <i>good deal of care</i> and a
<i>little port wine</i>; the other, a <i>little care</i> and a <i>good deal of port
wine</i>. I prefer the former; but if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> any of the clergy prefer the

Sir Thomas, "the pun will do much better in English, 'Honors <i>change</i>
Manners.'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Canning</span> and another gentleman were looking at a picture of the Deluge:

elephant did not secure <i>an inside</i> place."&mdash;"He was too late, my
friend," replied Canning; "he was detained <i>packing up his trunk</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> one was mentioning in Lamb's presence the cold-heartedness of the

there</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A shopkeeper</span> at Doncaster had for his virtues obtained the name of the

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor Garth</span>, who used frequently to go to the Wit's Coffee House, the
Cocoa-Tree, in St. James's Street, was sitting there one morning
conversing with two persons of rank, when Rowe, the poet, who was seldom
very attentive to his dress and appearance, but still insufferably vain
of being noticed by persons of consequence, entered. Placing himself in
a box nearly opposite to that in which the doctor sat, he looked
constantly round with a view of catching his eye; but not succeeding, he
desired the waiter to ask him for his snuff-box, which he knew to be a
valuable one, set with diamonds, and the present of some foreign prince.
After taking a pinch, he returned the box, but asked for it again so
repeatedly, that Garth, who knew him well, perceived the drift, and
taking from his pocket a pencil, wrote on the lid the two Greek
characters, [Greek: Ph R] (phi, rho) <i>Fie! Rowe!</i> The poet was so
mortified, that he quitted the room immediately.</p>

good health at present</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<h4>MDCLXII.&mdash;A BEARABLE PUN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> illiterate vendor of beer wrote over his door at Harrogate, "<i>Bear</i>
sold here."&mdash;"He spells the word quite correctly," said Theodore Hook,
"if he means to apprise us that the article is his own <i>Bruin</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCLXIII.&mdash;CITY GLUTTON.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> celebrated John Wilkes attended a City dinner not long after his
promotion to city honors. Among the guests was a noisy vulgar deputy, a
great glutton, who, on his entering the dinner-room, always with great
deliberation took off his wig, suspended it on a pin, and with due
solemnity put on a white cotton nightcap. Wilkes, who certainly was a
high-bred man, and never accustomed to similar exhibitions, could not
take his eyes from so strange and novel a picture. At length the deputy,
with unblushing familiarity, walked up to Wilkes, and asked him whether
he did not think that his nightcap became him. "O, yes, sir," replied
Wilkes, "but it would look much better if it was pulled quite <i>over</i>
your face."</p>

<h4>MDCLXIV.&mdash;A PRETTY REPLY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Melbourne</span>, inspecting the kitchen of the Reform Club, jocosely
remarked to Alexis Soyer, <i>chef de cuisine</i>, that his female assistants
were all very pretty. "Yes, my lord," replied Soyer; "<i>plain</i> cooks will
not do here."</p>

<h4>MDCLXV.&mdash;A CONVENIENT THEORY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> charity meetings, one Mould always volunteered to go round with the
hat, but was suspected of sparing his own pocket. Overhearing one day a
hint to that effect, he made the following speech: "Other gentlemen puts
down what they thinks proper, and so does I. Charity's a private
concern, and what I gives is <i>nothing to nobody</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCLXVI.&mdash;BUT ONE GOOD TRANSLATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dryden's</span> translation of Virgil being commended by a right reverend

<h4>MDCLXVII.&mdash;PHILIP, EARL OF STANHOPE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>, Earl of Stanhope, whose dress always corresponded with the
simplicity of his manners, was once prevented from going into the House
of Peers, by a doorkeeper who was unacquainted with his person. Lord
Stanhope was resolved to get into the House without explaining who he
was; and the doorkeeper, equally determined on his part, said to him,
"Honest man, you have no business here. <i>Honest man</i> you <i>can</i> have no
business <i>in this place</i>."&mdash;"I believe," rejoined his lordship, "you are
right; <i>honest men</i> can have no business here."</p>

<h4>MDCLXVIII.&mdash;RIGID IMPARTIALITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney Smith</span>, calling one day upon a fellow contributor to the
<i>Edinburgh Review,</i> found him reading a book preparatory to writing an
account of it, and expostulated with him. "Why, how do you manage?"
asked his friend. "I never," said the wit, "read a book <i>before</i>
reviewing it; <i>it prejudices one so</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCLXIX.&mdash;WHITBREAD'S ENTIRE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the approach of the election at Westminster, when Earl Percy was
returned, Mr. Denis O'Brien, the agent of Mr. Sheridan, said, that
"there were thousands in Westminster who would sooner vote for the Duke
of Northumberland's porter, than give their support to a man of talent
and probity, like Mr. Sheridan." Mr. Whitbread, alarmed for the
interests of Mr. S. by the intemperate language of his agent, wished him
to take some public notice of it in the way of censure; but Sheridan
only observed, "that to be sure his friend O'Brien was wrong and
intemperate, as far as related to the Duke of Northumberland's porter;
though he had no doubt there were thousands in Westminster who would
give the preference to Mr. Whitbread's <i>entire</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCLXX.&mdash;A FOOL AND HIS MONEY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> spendthrift being apprised that he had given a shilling when
sixpence would have been enough, remarked that "He knew no difference
between a <i>shilling</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span> and <i>sixpence</i>."&mdash;"But you will, young gentleman,"

Charles the First and his son James the Second,&mdash;that the former's was a
<i>wet</i> martyrdom, and the other's a <i>dry one</i>.</p>

<h4>MDCLXXII.&mdash;INSURANCE ASSURANCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> collector in a country church, where a brief was read for a sufferer
from fire, flattered himself that he had been unusually successful in
the collection, as he fancied he saw an agent to one of the fire-offices
put a note into the box. On examining the contents, however, he found
that the note had not issued from any bank, but merely bore these
admonitory words, "Let them <i>insure</i>, as they wish to be saved."</p>

<h4>MDCLXXIII.&mdash;GENUINE LAZINESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> farmer, inspecting his father's concerns in the time of
hay-harvest, found a body of the mowers asleep, when they should have
been at work. "What is this?" cried the youth; "why, me, you are so
indolent, that I would give a crown to know which is the most lazy of
you."&mdash;"I am he," cried the one nearest to him, still stretching himself
at his ease. "Here then" said the youth, holding out the money. "O,
Master George," said the fellow, folding his arms, "do pray take the
trouble of <i>putting it into my pocket</i> for me."</p>

<h4>MDCLXXIV.&mdash;CUTTING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A country</span> editor thinks that Richelieu, who declared that "The pen was
mightier than the sword," ought to have spoken a good word for the
"scissors." Jerrold called scissors "an editor's steel-pen."</p>

<h4>MDCLXXV.&mdash;GONE OUT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> calling one day on a gentleman at the west<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span> end of the town,
where his visits were more frequent than welcome, was told by the
servant that her master had gone out. "O, well, never mind, I'll speak
to your mistress."&mdash;"She's also gone out, sir." The gentleman, not
willing to be denied admission, said, as it was a cold day, he would
step in, and sit down by the fire a few minutes. "Ah! sir, but it is
<i>gone out</i> too," replied the girl.</p>

<h4>MDCLXXVI.&mdash;A GOOD JUDGE.</h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honesty</span> is the best policy," said a Scotchman. "I know it, my friend,
for <i>I have tried baith</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCLXXVII.&mdash;MR. CHARLES YORKE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mr. Charles Yorke was returned a member for the University of
Cambridge, about the year 1770, he went round the Senate to thank those
who had voted for him. Among the number was a Mr. P., who was proverbial
for having the largest and most hideous face that ever was seen. Mr.
Yorke, in thanking him, said, "Sir, I have great reason to be thankful
to my friends in general, but confess myself under a particular
obligation to <i>you</i> for the <i>very remarkable countenance</i> you have
<i>shown</i> me upon this occasion."</p>

<h4>MDCLXXVIII.&mdash;THE SALIC LAW</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> a most sensible and valuable law, banishing gallantry and chivalry
from Cabinets, and preventing the amiable antics of grave statesmen.</p>

<h4>MDCLXXIX.&mdash;CHARLES JAMES FOX.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Byron's engagement in the West Indies, there was a great clamor
about the badness of the ammunition. Soon after this, Mr. Fox had a duel
with Mr. Adam. On receiving that gentleman's ball, and finding that it
had made but little impression, he exclaimed, "Egad, Adam, it had been
all over with me, if you had not charged with <i>government powder</i>!"</p>

<h4>MDCLXXX.&mdash;PREFERMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the daly inquirers after the health of an aged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span> Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;m,
during his indisposition, no one was more sedulously punctual than
the Bishop of E&mdash;&mdash;r; and the invalid seemed to think that other motives
than those of anxious kindness might contribute to this solicitude. One
morning he ordered the messenger to be shown into his room, and thus
addressed him: "Be so good as present my compliments to my Lord Bishop,
and tell him that I am better, much better; but that the Bishop of
W&mdash;&mdash;r has got a sore throat, arising from a bad cold, <i>if that will
do</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCLXXXI.&mdash;COMPLIMENTARY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> dining at an hotel, was annoyed by a stupid waiter
continually coming hovering round the table, and desired him to retire.
"Excuse me, sir," said Napkin, drawing himself up, "but I'm
<i>responsible</i> for the silver."</p>

<h4>MDCLXXXII.&mdash;DR. DONNE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Donne</span>, the Dean of St. Paul's, having married a lady of a rich and
noble family without the consent of the parents, was treated with great
asperity. Having been told by the father that he was to expect no money
from him, the doctor went home and wrote the following note to him:
"John Donne, Anne Donne, <i>undone</i>." This quibble had the desired effect,
and the distressed couple were restored to favor.</p>

<h4>MDCLXXXIII.&mdash;VULGARITY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Walter Scott</span> once happening to hear his daughter Anne say of
something, that it was <i>vulgar</i>, gave the young lady the following
temperate rebuke: "My love, you speak like a very young lady; do you
know, after all, the meaning of this word <i>vulgar</i>? 'Tis only <i>common</i>;
nothing that is common, except wickedness, can deserve to be spoken of
in a tone of contempt; and when you have lived to my years, you will be
disposed to agree with me in thanking God that nothing really worth
having or caring about in this world is <i>uncommon</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCLXXXIV.&mdash;AN EXPENSIVE JOB.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> passing a country church while under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> repair, observed to
one of the workmen, that he thought it would be an expensive job. "Why,
yes," replied he; "but in my opinion we shall accomplish what our
reverend divine has endeavored to do, for the last thirty years, in
vain."&mdash;"What is that?" said the gentleman. "Why, bring all the parish
<i>to repentance</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCLXXXV.&mdash;PROSINESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A prosy</span> old gentleman meeting Jerrold, related a long, limp account of a
stupid practical joke, concluding with the information that "he really

had," was Jerrold's reply.</p>

<h4>MDCLXXXVI.&mdash;A PLEASANT MESSAGE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bartleman</span>, a celebrated bass-singer, was taken ill, just before the
commencement of the musical festival at Gloucester: another basso was
applied to, at a short notice, who attended, and acquitted himself to
the satisfaction of everybody. When he called on the organist to be
paid, the latter thanked him most cordially for the noble manner in
which he had sung; and concluded with the following very complimentary
and pleasant message: "When you see poor Bartleman, give my best regards
<i>to him</i>; and tell him how much we <i>missed him</i> during the festival!"</p>

<h4>MDCLXXXVII.&mdash;EXISTENCE OF MATTER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Berkeley, the celebrated author of the Immaterial Theory, was one
morning musing in the cloisters of Dublin College, an acquaintance came
up to him, and, seeing him rapt in contemplation, hit him a smart rap on
the shoulder with his cane. The dean starting, called out, "<i>What's the
matter</i>?" His acquaintance, looking him steadily in the face, replied,
"<i>No matter, Berkeley</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCLXXXVIII.&mdash;A SAUCY ANSWER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Barrister</span> attempting to browbeat a female witness, told her she had

<h4>MDCXC.&mdash;AN INHOSPITABLE IRISHMAN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Boyle Roach</span>, the droll of the Irish bar, sent an amusingly equivocal
invitation to an Irish nobleman of his acquaintance: "I hope, my Lord,
if ever you come within a mile of my house, that you'll <i>stay there all
night</i>." When he was suffering from an attack of gout, he thus rebuked
his shoemaker: "O, you're a precious blockhead to do directly the
reverse of what I desired you. I told you to make one of the shoes
<i>larger</i> than the other, and instead of that you have made one of them
<i>smaller</i> than the other!"</p>

<h4>MDCXCI.&mdash;GOOD ENOUGH FOR A PIG.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An Irish</span> peasant being asked why he permitted his pig to take up its
quarters with his family, made an answer abounding with satirical
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>: "Why not? Doesn't the place afford every convenience that <i>a
pig can require</i>?"</p>

<h4>MDCXCII.&mdash;FARCICAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Bannister's time, a farce was performed under the title of "Fire and
Water."&mdash;"I predict its fate," said he. "What fate?" whispered the
anxious author at his side. "What fate!" said Bannister; "why, what can
fire and water produce but a <i>hiss</i>?"</p>

<h4>MDCXCIII.&mdash;TOO MUCH AT ONCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chesterfield</span> one day, at an inn where he dined, complained very
much that the plates and dishes were very dirty. The waiter, with a
degree of pertness, observed, "It is said every one must <i>eat a peck of
dirt</i> before he dies."&mdash;"That may be true," said Chesterfield, "but no
one is obliged to eat it all <i>at one meal</i>, you dirty dog."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<h4>MDCXCV.&mdash;POSSIBLE CENSORS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Cadogan</span> was boasting of the eminence of his profession, and spoke
loudly against the injustice of the world, which was so satirical
against it; "but," he added, "I have escaped, for no one complains of
me."&mdash;"That is more than you can tell, doctor," said a lady who was
present, "unless you know what people <i>say in the other world</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCXCVI.&mdash;A CONNUBIAL COMPLIMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span>, walking with her husband at the seaside, inquired of him the

would be <i>exported</i>, and <i>I</i> should be <i>transported</i>!"</p>

<h4>MDCXCVII.&mdash;DOUBLE SIGHT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> with one eye laid a wager with another man, that he (the one-eyed

lost," says the first; "I can see the <i>two</i> eyes in your face, and you
can see only <i>one</i> in mine."</p>

<h4>MDCXCVIII.&mdash;WITTY AT HIS OWN EXPENSE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheridan</span> was once asked by a gentleman: "How is it that your name has

<h4>MDCC.&mdash;A PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Lord Dudley and Ward was one of the most absent of men. Meeting
Sydney Smith one day in the street, he invited him to meet himself!
"Dine with me to-day,&mdash;dine with me to-day,&mdash;I will get Sydney Smith to
meet you." The witty canon admitted the temptation held out to him, but
said, "<i>he was engaged with him elsewhere</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCCI.&mdash;A ROYAL JEST.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A captain</span>, remarkable for his uncommon height, being one day at the
rooms at Bath, the late Princess Amelia was struck with his appearance;

"Rather for the <i>steeple,</i>" replied the royal humorist.</p>

<h4>MDCCII.&mdash;EXTREMELY SULPHUROUS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chesterfield</span>, being told that a certain termagant and scold was
married to a gamester, replied, "that <i>cards and brimstone</i> made the

<h4>MDCCIII.&mdash;A JOKE FROM THE NORTH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reigning <i>bore</i> at one time in Edinburgh was Professor L&mdash;&mdash;; his
favorite subject the <i>North Pole</i>. One day the arch tormentor met
Jeffrey in a narrow lane, and began instantly on the North Pole.
Jeffrey, in despair, and out of all patience, darted past him,
exclaiming, "Hang the North Pole!" Sydney Smith met Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; shortly
after, boiling over with indignation at Jeffrey's contempt of the North
Pole. "O, my dear fellow," said Sydney, "never mind; no one minds what
Jeffrey says, you know; he is a privileged person,&mdash;he respects nothing,
absolutely nothing. Why, you will scarcely credit it, but it is not more
than a week ago that I heard him speak disrespectfully of the
<i>Equator</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCCIV.&mdash;MULTIPLYING ONE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sydney Smith</span> once said: "I remember entering a room with glass all round
it at the French embassy, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> saw myself reflected on every side. I
took it for a <i>meeting of the clergy</i>, and was delighted of course."</p>

<h4>MDCCV.&mdash;AN AFFIRMATIVE EPIGRAM.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">The fair one replied to me, "No, Richard, no."<br /></span>

<h4>MDCCVI.&mdash;THE RULING PASSION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A lady's</span> beauty is dear to her at all times. A very lovely woman, worn

gray</i>!</p>

<h4>MDCCVII.&mdash;INDIFFERENCE TO DEATH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A prisoner</span>, who had received notice that he was to die the next morning,

with them. He answered, "I never eat anything that I expect will <i>not
digest</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCCVIII.&mdash;SELF-INTEREST.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who wish to tax anything containing <i>intelligence</i>, must be
actuated by selfish views, seeing that it is an imposition of which they
are not likely to feel <i>the burden</i>.</p>

<h4>MDCCIX.&mdash;ALL THE DIFFERENCE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">A Glasgow</span> professor met a poor student passing along one of the courts,
and remarked to him that his gown was very short. "<i>It will be long
enough before I get another</i>," answered the student. The reply tickled
the professor's fancy so much that he continued in a state of suppressed
laughter after passing on. Meeting a brother professor, who asked him
what was amusing him so much, he told the story with a slightly varied
reading. "I asked that fellow why he had so short a gown, and he
answered, <i>it will be a long time before I get another</i>."&mdash;"Well,
there's nothing very funny in that."&mdash;"Neither there is," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span> the
professor, "I don't understand how it amused me so much. It must have
been something in <i>the way he said it</i>."</p>

<h4>MDCCX.&mdash;FOOTE'S LAST JOKE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Foote was on his way to France, for change of air, he went into the
kitchen at the inn at Dover, to order a particular dish for dinner. The
true English cook boasted that she had never set foot out of her
country. On this, the invalid gravely observed, "Why, cookey, that's
very extraordinary, as they tell me up stairs that you have been several
times <i>all over grease</i>!"&mdash;"They may tell you what they please above or
below stairs," replied the cook, "but I was never ten miles from Dover
in my life!"&mdash;"Nay, now, that must be a <i>fib</i>," says Foote, "for I have
myself seen you at <i>Spithead</i>!" The next day (October 21, 1777) the
exhausted wit "shuffled off this mortal coil."</p>

<h4>MDCCXI.&mdash;<i>L'Envoy</i>.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is so much genuine humor in the following jocular <span class="smcap">dinner code</span>,
that we cannot do better than close our little volume with it.</p>

<h4>DINNER CODE.</h4>

<p class='center'><i>Of the Amphitryon.&mdash;His Rights.</i></p>

<p>Art. 1.&mdash;The Amphitryon is the king of the table: his empire lasts as
long as the meal, and ends with it.</p>

<p>Art. 2.&mdash;It is lawful for his glass to exceed in capacity those of his
guests.</p>

<p>Art. 3.&mdash;He may be lively with his male guests, and gallant towards the
females; to such of them as are pretty he may risk a compliment or two,
which is sure to be received from him with an approving smile.</p>

<p class='center'><i>His Duties.</i></p>

<p>Art. 1.&mdash;Fulfilling to the utmost the laws of hospitality, he watches
with paternal solicitude over the welfare of the stomachs committed to
his care; reassures the timid, encourages the modest, and incites the
vigorous appetite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>Art. 2.&mdash;He must abstain from praising either his dishes or his wines.</p>

<p>Art. 3.&mdash;He is not to take advantage of his situation to utter stale
jests or vulgar puns. A careful perusal of "The Jest Book" will be his
best security against a violation of this <i>article</i>.</p>

<p>Art. 4.&mdash;The police of the table belongs of right to him; he should
never permit a plate or a glass to be either full or empty.</p>

<p>Art. 5.&mdash;On rising from table, he should cast a scrutinizing glance over
the glasses. If he sees them not quite emptied, let him take warning by
it to choose either his guests or his wine better for the future.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Of the Guests.</i></p>

<p>Art. 1.&mdash;The first duty of a guest is to arrive at the time named, at
whatever inconvenience to himself.</p>

<p>Art. 2.&mdash;When the Amphitryon offers any dish to a guest, his only civil
way of declining it is by requesting to be helped a second time to that
of which he has just partaken.</p>

<p>Art. 3.&mdash;A guest who is a man of the world will never begin a
conversation until the first course is over; up to that point, dinner is
a serious affair, from which the attention of the party ought not to be
inconsiderately distracted.</p>

<p>Art. 4.&mdash;Whatever conversation is going on ought to be suspended, even
in the middle of a sentence, upon the entrance of a <i>dinde aux truffes</i>.</p>

<p>Art. 5.&mdash;An applauding laugh is indispensable to every joke of the
Amphitryon.</p>

<p>Art. 6.&mdash;A guest is culpable who speaks ill of his entertainer during
the first three hours after dinner. Gratitude should last at least as
long as digestion.</p>

<p>Art. 7.&mdash;To leave anything on your plate is to insult your host in the
person of his cook.</p>

<p>Art. 8.&mdash;A guest who leaves the table deserves the fate of a soldier who
deserts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><i>On Vicinity to Ladies.</i></p>

<p>Art. 1.&mdash;He who sits next to a lady becomes at once her <i>cavaliere
servente</i>. He is bound to watch over her glass with as much interest as
over his own.</p>

<p>Art. 2.&mdash;The gentleman owes aid and protection to his fair neighbor in
the selection of food; the lady on her part is bound to respect and obey
the recommendations of her knight on this subject.</p>

<p>Art. 3.&mdash;It is bad taste for the gentleman to advance beyond politeness
during the first course; in the second, however, he is bound to be
complimentary; and he is at liberty to glide into tenderness with the
dessert.</p>

<p class='center'><i>On Vicinity to Men.</i></p>

<p>Art. 1.&mdash;When two gentlemen sit together, they owe no duties to each
other beyond politeness and reciprocal offers of wine and water,&mdash;the
<i>last</i> offer becomes an error after one refusal.</p>

<p>Art. 2.&mdash;On being helped to a dish, you should at once accept any
precedence offered you by your neighbor; ceremony serves only to cool
the plate in question for both parties.</p>

<p>Art. 3.&mdash;If you sit near the Amphitryon, your criticisms on the repast
must be conveyed in a whisper; aloud you can do nothing but approve.</p>

<p>Art. 4.&mdash;Under no pretext can two neighbors at table be permitted to
converse together on their private affairs, unless, indeed, one of them
is inviting the other to dinner.</p>

<p>Art. 5.&mdash;Two neighbors who understand each other may always get more
wine than the rest of the guests; they have only to say by turns to each
other, with an air of courtesy, "Shall we take some wine?"</p>

<p class='center'><i>On Vicinity to Children.</i></p>

<p>Single Article.&mdash;The only course to be pursued, if you have the
misfortune to be placed next a child at table, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span> to make him tipsy as
quick as you can, that he may be sent out of the room by Mamma.</p>

<p class='center'><i>On the Means of reconciling Politeness with Egotism.</i></p>

<p>Art. 1.&mdash;The epicure's serious attention should be fixed upon the
articles on the table; he may lavish his politeness, his wit, and his
gayety upon the people who sit round it.</p>

<p>Art. 2.&mdash;By helping the dish next yourself (should you not dine <i>&agrave; la
Russe</i>) you acquire a right to be helped to any other dish on the table.</p>

<p>Art. 3.&mdash;A carver must be very unskilful who cannot, by a little
sleight-of-hand, smuggle aside the best morsel of a dish, and thus, when
serving himself <i>last</i>, serve himself also the <i>best</i>.</p>

<p>Art. 4.&mdash;Your host's offers are sometimes insincere when they refer to
some magnificent dish yet uncut. In such cases you should refuse feebly
for yourself, but accept on behalf of the lady next you,&mdash;merely out of
politeness to her.</p>

<p>Art. 5.&mdash;The thigh of all birds, boiled, is preferable to the wing:
never lose sight of this in helping ignoramuses or ladies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>
